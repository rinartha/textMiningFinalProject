https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4797083,Duck hunt comes to conclusion in southern Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — One would be tempted to call it a “wild goose chase” but it was a duck that went missing with police precincts launching a massive hunt since Monday (Jan.30).Firecracker celebrations for the Jade Emperor, also known as the Lord of Heaven, startled a domesticated duck living in Meinong District, Kaohsiung, leading it to take flight and flee in the middle of the night, posing a threat to itself and traffic, per Liberty Times.Surveillance footage later spotted the duck avoiding traffic from passing scooters and cars. The runaway duck then encountered a concerned couple who quickly scooped it up in their arms and brought it home with them.Kaohsiung’s Qishan Police Department said the duck hunt began when they were contacted by a woman surnamed Hsueh (薛) in her 60s who reported her pure white call duck had recently gone missing. She was heartbroken as she had been raising her feathered companion for more than two years.Call ducks are a particular breed popular in Holland for their calm demeanor and small size. They are easily domesticated and trained, so much so that they can be used as real-life decoys for duck hunting. They are also suitable as pets.However, they may be triggered by loud noises such as recent volleys of firecrackers to celebrate the Jade Emperor on the ninth day of the Lunar New Year, a sound which emanated from one household after another in Meinong. It was this loud noise which caused Hsueh’s call duck to fly over a fence and disappear.Zhongtan Police Precinct Chief Fu Chun-yi (傅鈞詣) said Hsueh asked police for assistance to track down her duck. Police officer Kuo Wang-lin (郭旺霖) checked surveillance footage in the area and found that her duck traveled along Zhongxiao Road where it eventually encountered a concerned couple on a scooter.The policeman then checked the license plate of the scooter and made a call to the home address. A man surnamed Cheng (鄭) answered and said that he was worried the duck would be hit by a car, so he picked it up, and added he also checked if there was an anklet or other identifying marks.With no way to contact the owner, he simply took it home and began to care for it, where he was surprised how comfortable the duck was with people, leading him to speculate it was someone's pet. He struggled with how to deal with the duck until he received the call from the police.According to the pet industry, call ducks can fetch a market price between NT$5,000-20,000 (US$150-600). It makes a peculiar sound and a mature male can grow to no more than 570 grams.Police later went to Cheng's house to collect the duck and returned it to Hsueh at the Zhongtan Police Precinct. Hsueh was overjoyed after being reunited with her prized pet, profusely thanking both the police and the public for their help.",2023/2/1,2304,Society

This marks the first batch of funds recovered by the Taiwan government following a series of corruption scandals that shocked Taiwan in the 1990s.Wang had been accused of accepting NT$14.46 billion in kickbacks in the Lafayette scandal, which was deposited in several countries. According to the MOJ, Wang and his family became wanted after fleeing Taiwan, though charges against Wang were dropped after his death in the U.K. in 2015.In 2021, a court ruling made in Switzerland, where most of Wang’s kickbacks were deposited, declared that nearly NT$7.4 billion of funds from the Wang family’s frozen accounts will be returned to Taiwan. Other funds that are still in the Wang family's Switzerland accounts, amounting to nearly NT$20 billion, would be unfrozen as their connection to the Lafayette case had not been proven.The Lafayette scandal is the biggest corruption scandal involving the Taiwan military since its establishment.

Phil Davidson, along with a group including colleagues from the U.S. think tank the National Bureau of Asian Research, arrived Monday in the capital Taipei following a string of delegate visits to Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory, since tensions with the mainland spiked in August with the visit of then-U.S. Speaker Nancy Pelosi.“I’m here to listen and learn from our hosts; thus far, I’ve done both,” he said. “I'm looking forward to continuing our discussions with President Tsai today and hearing her perspectives on the security environment and her outlook on U.S.-Taiwan relations.”China’s People’s Liberation Army has stepped up its pressure on Taiwan in the past few years, sending navy vessels and fighter planes near the island.Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that 20 Chinese aircraft crossed the central line in the Taiwan Strait — a long-time unofficial buffer zone between the sides, which separated during a civil war in 1949. It sent 14 other planes in nearby airspace.A day later, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said 17 Chinese aircraft crossed the median line Wednesday, with a total of 23 planes sent to fly around the island.“Faced with the expansion of authoritarianism, Taiwan must strengthen our ability to defend ourselves,” she said, pointing to the upcoming extension of mandatory military service that she had just announced in December.Tsai thanked Davidson on Thursday for his contributions to the “safety of the Taiwan Straits.”Davidson, while still serving as the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, had warned that China's claims over Taiwan were a rising and tangible threat.“Taiwan is clearly one of their ambitions before then, and I think the threat is manifest during this decade — in fact, in the next six years,” he told the Senate Armed Forces Committee in 2021.He clarified this remark while in Japan just before his visit to Taiwan, saying that the scenario would not necessarily be an all-out war.“In my mind, that can be many lesser things than an all-out invasion. One of those would be the threats to outer islands, and I think it’s a grave security concern of Taiwan’s,” he told the Japan Times.___AP senior video producer Johnson Lai contributed to this report.",2023/2/2,655,Politics

            Of the 34 People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, 20 were tracked in Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), according to the MND. Two Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets were monitored in the northeast sector, while two Shaanxi Y-8 electronic intelligence planes, one Harbin BZK-005 reconnaissance drone, one BZK-007 reconnaissance drone, one Shaanxi Y-8 electronic warfare plane, and one Shaanxi Y-8 anti-submarine warfare plane entered the southwest corner of the ADIZ.

            Meanwhile, six Shenyang J-16 fighter planes either entered the southwest corner of the ADIZ or crossed the Taiwan Strait median line. In addition, four Chengdu J-10 jet fighters and two Shenyang J-11 fighter jets also crossed the median line.

            In response, Taiwan sent aircraft, naval ships, and used land-based missiles to monitor PLA aircraft and vessels.











            Since September 2020, China has increased its use of gray zone tactics by routinely sending aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ. Gray zone tactics are defined as “an effort or series of efforts beyond steady-state deterrence and assurance that attempts to achieve one’s security objectives without resort to direct and sizable use of force.”

It's a global competition in ways that could be even more intense than competition with the Soviets was,"" he said.There was no immediate comment from China's Washington embassy about the remarks from Burns or the balloon flight.Burns said the next six months will be ""critical"" for Ukraine, where Moscow has been making incremental gains in recent weeks.He also said Iran's government was increasingly unsettled by affairs within the country, citing the courage of what he described as ""fed up"" Iranian women.",2023/2/3,2669,Politics

He met with Swedish direct democracy expert Bruno Kauffman to discuss the failure of a local referendum that sought to oppose the construction, held in June last year.Organized by local campaigners, the referendum gained enough support within one week to meet the requirements for a government review. According to Keelung HiHi, the referendum ran into difficulties when the Keelung city government (then led by current Minister for the Interior Lin Yu-chang (林右昌) referred the issue to the Cabinet.The Cabinet decided the proposed works came under the purview of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and therefore was not a matter for local authorities to decide.Hsieh has disputed this, citing the Local Government Act. He said the land reclamation process proposed for construction of the power plants constitutes an environmental issue, which the act gives local governments the authority to control.Leader of the referendum effort and Keelung city councilor Wang Xing-zhi (王醒之) said that if the central government was to decide on the outcome, it would be a disruption of local democracy, according to CNA. UDN reported that Wang said that he will decide next week how to move forward, though he is sure the outcome of the proposed construction will be decided by local government.“It will not be sent to the central government to get caught up in their confusion, the city government will be responsible for approving it directly,” he said.The “Fourth Connection” is an abbreviation for the “Fourth Natural Gas Terminal” (第四天然氣接收站) and describes a proposal to construct Taiwan’s fourth port for receiving imports of natural gas and accompanying power plant. The proposal seeks to use the site of coal power plants near Keelung that have either recently been or are set for decommissioning.The new power plants will greatly reduce air pollution, and will serve nearly 5 million people in the north of Taiwan. However, converting the plants to natural gas will have a severe impact on the surrounding marine environment, and affect the livelihoods of local fishermen.The plan has already been revised significantly in order to minimize the environmental impact, with the proposed site being relocated eastward to avoid the destruction of coral reefs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800139,Taiwan's remote work solution provider finds success in Western and Asian markets,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Kdan Mobile co-founder Wang Wei-chung (王為中) joined the Startup Island TAIWAN podcast on Friday (Feb. 3) to discuss the success of Kdan, its unusual head office location, and how focusing on core functionality was key to the company’s success.Software as a service (SaaS) is a massive growth area, with predictions for total investment in the industry exceeding US$70 billion (NT$2 trillion) in 2022, more than four times the amount it was a decade ago. Despite this being a reduction in investment levels from the 2021 peak of US$98 billion, Wang said he believes the future is still in software.“The app market in my opinion has already tapped out ... When Kdan launched its first app there were fewer than 1,000 apps on the Appstore, so it was relatively easier to gain exposure,” he said. “We don’t call ourselves an app developer any more. We started off as an app developer to get our foot in the door. We are a software solution provider at this point.”Wang said the software solutions Kdan provides are about optimizing efficiency and cultivating creativity in the evolving digital workplace. They have done this by focusing on the core functionality of the software they provide.“Most of them have too many bells and whistles, and the majority of clients just want the core functionality,” Wang said. For one of their most successful products, their PDF software, this meant reducing the number of features, and putting more focus on one, the digital signature.Wang said the digital signature function has been very popular, especially during the pandemic, when users were seeking contactless ways to sign and send documents. He also said Kdan’s focusing on core functionality means the product is easier to use from the beginning, which also helps attract customers.“Many of our customers were attracted to the solution because they wanted to save money, but after a few months they realized that is all they needed,” Wang said.One of Kdan's most popular services has been digital signatures. (Kdan Facebook photo)Having a diverse team is important for Wang, and so is having a high level of English fluency. “I value diversity. I understand that you have got to have different ideas. You’ve got to be able to find a way to have that idea influx, and that influx is going to be better if you have people from different backgrounds,” he said.Wang said his business, and other Taiwanese in the SaaS space would benefit from more government help. “Not only capital influx, that’s obviously one important thing,” Wang said, “but how do we bridge the Taiwanese startups with the startup communities in the West.”He said the Taiwan government could support businesses to attend the Consumer Electronics Show in the U.S., the industry’s largest expo, helping them to make connections in the world’s largest consumer market.Unlike most tech startups in Taiwan, Kdan is headquartered in Tainan. “When (my other co-founders) told me they wanted to pick Tainan as a location, I was taken aback,” Wang said, but the choice has turned out to be a good one.“There were a lot of talents that were forced to go to Taipei, because they weren’t able to find any opportunities in the southern part of the country,” Wang said. He said that they offer staff an opportunity to work in their hometown, and be with their families and their communities.",2023/2/4,1168,Business

            The congressman said that when China fired missiles near Taiwan and intruded in the country’s air defense identification zone, it was inappropriate and provocative behavior. He went on to say that any elected member of Congress has the right to visit an elected official of any country, including Taiwan.

            In a memo obtained by NBC, Minihan said, “I hope I am wrong.

The one minute 25 second video production includes the usual shots of red lanterns and touching family moments, jarringly interspersed with threatening images of war and military strength.It caught the attention of the TVBS anchor and military correspondent Tingting Liu (劉亭廷), who described it on Twitter as “quite disturbing to many in TW” (Taiwan).It starts with a facetime call between a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) jet fighter dad and his daughter, who reminds him it's the Lantern Festival. He tells her he will not forget and will “hang moon lights” for her when he flies that night — the point being the moon represents unity and togetherness.This wishful thinking on the part of China’s leadership plays out with shots of jets scrambling on patrols, warships menacing, and soldiers in action. The video follows up with images of missile launchers.Interestingly, the video shows footage from Eastern Theater Command exercises that menaced Taiwan after the visit of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August. It also launched multiple missiles in waters around Taiwan.Eastern Theater Command is responsible for ramping up daily incursions on Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), and crossing the Taiwan Strait median line.

The group said that if forced to close, many of the elderly, disabled, and otherwise disadvantaged people who gather recycling and sell it there would lose their already meager incomes.“Many people whose time and physical and mental conditions are difficult to integrate into the mainstream job market often choose waste picking,” Ngóo-kak said on Thursday (Feb. 2). “Waste picking work can be said to be the last line of defense for the disadvantaged to live independently.”The income from collecting recycling for over 12 hours per working day often fails to exceed NT$6000 per month (US$200), while nearly a third of the recyclers are women over 65, according to Ngóo-kak.The manager of the recycling center surnamed Huang (黃), told reporters the yard had been open since 1965, passing through three generations of his family. He said he was notified by the Taipei City Government in Nov. that the center violated land use laws and would have to close.Ngóo-kak says that after years of disadvantaged recyclers helping keep the community clean, the government is now abandoning them. “(The recyclers) should become cooperators in the transformation of the urban environment and net-zero emissions,” they said.Acting Chief of the Urban Planning Division of the Department of Urban Development Su Hsin-hui (蘇芯慧) said that the land was in a type 3 residential area, in which resource recycling yards are illegal.

As many countries around the world experience an aging population, the potential for this market continues to roll upward.Taiwan is the third largest exporter of wheelchairs in the world, following China and Germany. Growth was constrained in 2020, coinciding with the COVID pandemic, as many hospitals turned to video consultation and tele-medicine with reduced capacity for in-person hospital visits.With the pandemic easing in 2021 and 2022, the export value of wheelchairs has risen. According to the MOEA’s Bureau of Foreign Trade, wheelchairs made in Taiwan are mainly exported to the U.S. and the United Kingdom, which together account for more than 50% of total exports, and exports will show double-digit growth in 2022. Taiwan exports to the U.S. alone hit a new high of US$22 million (NT$661 million).Regarding the distinctions between major exporting countries such as China, Germany, and Taiwan, the MOEA’s Bureau of Trade pointed out that China mainly focuses on the low-price wheelchair market in U.S., Japan, Russian, and ASEAN countries. Whereas Germany is focused on the high-end market with the priciest wheelchairs and primarily supplies the European market.In terms of price, Taiwan finds itself situated between China and Germany. Taiwan-made wheelchairs and accessories are closely aligned with the needs of users and family care. For example, seat design can be adjusted according to the user's body shape. Also, special measures go into quality control and safety should a collision occur.In recent years, Taiwanese factories have invested in the development of lightweight wheelchairs and special mobility aids, with some even using IoT technology to provide feedback to manufacturers on user experience as well as maintenance.",2023/2/7,914,Business

AmCham surveyed members between Nov. 15 and Dec. 16, 2022, showing 85% of respondents felt confident about Taiwan’s economic outlook over the next three years.Confidence aside, AmCham called on Taiwan to speed up deregulation in order to set the conditions for a Taiwan-U.S. free trade agreement. “Taiwan requires a faster pace of economic reform and international economic engagement if it is to build the resilience needed to prosper,” AmCham said.While nearly 90% of AmCham members said they planned to maintain or increase investment in Taiwan, over a third said they would like to see less regulation in the economy.“Respondents identified regulations and policies as the most important area for improvement of Taiwan’s business climate,” AmCham said. Some respondents said they felt Taiwan’s laws and regulations have not been updated in response to changing societal and economic needs, and that regulations are interpreted inconsistently.“As sound regulatory practices are a focus area of the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade, AmCham recommends the government consider the Chamber’s constructive criticism and strive to establish a more investment-friendly regulatory environment,” the report said.Cross-strait relations were less of a concern for respondents. “67 percent reported no significant disruption by increased tensions across the Taiwan Strait during the second half of 2022,” AmCham said, but noted that nearly half of businesses surveyed have updated business continuity plans to address the new geopolitical climate.Over half of the companies surveyed have formally committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions, 100% renewable energy, or “similar initiatives,” however the report did not explain what those initiatives were. Despite making this commitment, some respondents reported concerns about the availability of green energy sources in Taiwan.",2023/2/7,449,Business

            A 27-year-old man surnamed Wang (汪) was suspected of killing his girlfriend surnamed Li (李). After committing the crime, he drove north and returned to his residence in Bade District, Taoyuan City, where he supposedly jumped to his death from the 19th floor, according to UDN.

According to Li, the team spent over 15 years developing the technique to grow the delicate fruit as three factors—blueberry variety, soil, and weather—are all important.Years of effort have paid off. A sprawling 30-hectare farm down the hills of Chiayi’s Alishan and along the Bazhang River can now mass produce the berry, harvested between December and May.The “Made in Taiwan” blueberries are touted as freshly picked and juicy. No further processing is involved when they are harvested and packaged, said the company. The product is now available via online orders or at 7-Eleven stores across the country.Taiwan has seen a surge in demand for blueberries.

One of the two alliances’ main goals was to advocate for the establishment of the Kinmen “permanent non-military zone” as an attempt to avert the possibility of cross-strait conflict.Shih responded to the news during an interview with CNA, saying he had immediately contacted Hung Hung-pin (洪鴻斌) one of the councilors. Hung reportedly expressed his hope that the Kinmen County Council will be able to invite him over for a visit.In December last year, Shih compared keeping Kinmen and Matsu armed to “burying a fuse right under the enemy’s feet.” He wrote, “Kinmen and Matsu are positioned in the range of the enemy’s traditional artillery, and once a war begins, they would be rendered helpless. Taiwan will not be able to save Kinmen and Matsu, and Kinmen and Matsu will not be able to protect Taiwan.”He urged Taiwan’s government to “remove the fuse” by withdrawing all troops stationed in the two outlying counties and establishing non-military and peaceful zones there instead.

            Li said that although Kinmen is a small island that is approximately 150 square kilometers, its role in cross-strait relations is sensitive, UDN reported. The basic living needs of Kinmenese are closely related to cross-strait relations, he added.

            For example, a water shortage should be easy to address, but it is a political issue for Kinmen, and governments on both sides of the strait are facing challenges to resolve this issue.

            He said that four years ago, the island began receiving water from the Jin River, in Quanzhou, China, and now 70-80% of Kinmen's water comes from China.











            Li also mentioned that the “mini-three links” had been affected by the suspension of cross-strait flights during the pandemic, which prevented Chinese immigrants and Kinmenese in China from traveling to Taiwan, per UDN. This decision involved political factors, he said.

            However, he pointed out that the three links have largely resumed. The deputy magistrate said Kinmen must seek a balance in cross-strait relations.

            Swiss lawmaker Fabian Molina said that his country is geographically unique within Europe, as it is surrounded by many small countries, which is quite similar to Kinmen’s situation. Molina said he empathizes with the island’s residents and hoped that the Swiss-Taiwan friendship group will have more exchanges with Kinmen in the future.

            The visiting delegation is led by Molina and Nicolas Walder, who are co-chairs of the Parliamentary Intergroup Switzerland-Taiwan, and includes lawmakers Yves Nidegger, Mustafa Atici, and Leonore Porchet, according to a MOFA press release.

            The trip is “a sign of support for Taiwan,” Molina told NZZ Magazin last month. It will focus on economic cooperation, democracy, and defense, and delve into issues such as “what could happen in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan,” he said.

The center’s staff were currently collecting diesel with which to generate electricity.Without any outside aid, Chiu estimated that the center will be able to operate for about one to two weeks.He said that there were currently no ambulances or police cars in the area, and many residents had come to the Taiwan Center for help, per CNA. In addition to accommodating disaster victims and providing hot food, the center also has electricity for people to charge their mobile phones.The Taiwan Center has a generator donated by the United Nations to provide electricity and a groundwater well to provide water, Chiu was quoted by CNA as saying. Aftershocks continue to occur in Hatay Province, and as long as there are aftershocks, victims will flood into the Taiwan Center, he added.In addition to the strong earthquake, what makes things worse is that the local winter came late this year, and the current nighttime low temperature is around zero degrees Celsius, the center director said, adding that it was estimated that about 300 to 400 people will spend the night in the center.As the severe earthquake has caused severe damage to the local community, Chiu estimated that it will take at least six months to a year before the normal supply of water and electricity can be restored. To cope with the difficult time, the Taiwan Center plans to install solar power generation equipment and a rainwater recovery system, hoping to resume normal operations in a short time, he said, urging Taiwanese people to donate to support this cause.",2023/2/8,1266,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4804990,Sweden opposes threat of force to resolve Taiwan Strait issue,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Sweden does not accept any threat of force in the Taiwan Strait, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said during a parliamentary interpellation session last Thursday (Feb. 2).

            “The use of military threats is of course unacceptable. Conflicts of opinion must be resolved peacefully and in a manner consistent with the democratic will of the people of Taiwan,” Billstrom said in response to lawmaker Rasmus Giertz’s concern that the Nordic nation was not acting fast enough to transform its representative office in Taipei to a “House of Sweden.”

            The foreign minister reaffirmed Sweden’s diplomatic relations with China but said it has long had “well-developed cooperation and exchange with Taiwan.” Sweden wants to continue developing ties with Taiwan within the framework of its “one China” policy, he said.

            He praised Taiwan’s democracy and advocacy for human rights and said it has one of the most important economies in the world. He pointed out that Sweden and Taiwan have close trade ties and cooperate in areas, including human rights, equality, climate, and innovation.











            “We naturally intend to continue developing this in different forms,” he said.

            Billstrom mentioned that lawmaker Bjorn Soder asked him how he would further push for Taiwan’s global participation a day earlier, on Feb. 1.

            He said the Swedish government supports Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization (WHO) and has urged the WHO director-general to invite Taiwan to participate as an observer at the World Health Assembly. The foreign minister added Sweden supported the statement France made on behalf of the EU member states at the opening of last year and this year's WHO board meetings, where the EU emphasized the importance of not leaving out any part of the world from the global health network.

            In October, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson highlighted the Chinese threat to Taiwan in a statement of government policy at the Swedish parliament. Kristersson expressed concern about China’s recent rhetoric directed at Taiwan. “Threats of military force are unacceptable,” he said.

            He also said Sweden will not tolerate aggressive states that intervene in a democratic country’s freedom and sovereignty. “Might does not make right,” he said.

            A Swedish parliamentary delegation visited Taiwan in April, affirming its support for Taiwan’s democracy, human rights, and freedom, and expressed optimism about future bilateral ties after a five-day visit.

Multiple national governments have banned the use of Huawei’s products due to the company’s suspected ties to China’s military.Since 2020, the company’s distribution capacity in Taiwan has been severely limited. This was due primarily to Huawei factories labeling products bound for Taiwan with the designation “Taiwan, China.” The company refused to comply with regulations outlined by Taiwan’s National Communications Commission to address the issue.Huawei’s products were subsequently banned from major distribution channels in the country. The company’s troubles have been compounded by legal restrictions on importing products to the U.S., and others which prevent U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei.For the past two years, Huawei has suffered severe drops in annual revenue, reporting a 32% decrease year over year in late 2021. A further decrease of 19% year over year was reported in late 2022.In late January, it was reported the Biden administration may be preparing to cut off Huawei's access to U.S. component suppliers entirely, in a move intended to restrict China's access to critical security technologies.Although some Taiwanese customers expressed concern over Huawei’s diminishing presence in Taiwan, the company assured its customers that their customer service hotline will still be open to deal with product issues. There are also several computer and smartphone repair centers throughout Taiwan that are licensed to repair Huawei products, according to the company announcement.",2023/2/10,3038,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806258,German businesses committed to Taiwan despite weak economic outlook,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — German businesses remain committed to staying in Taiwan, despite a relatively weak economic outlook for 2023.Alexander Hirschle, Taiwan and Philippines Asia-Pacific Director of Germany Trade & Invest, said Taiwan businesses should “fasten their seatbelts” for at least the first half of 2023, in contrast with strong growth results in 2022. Hirschle made the comments at the German Trade Office's (GTO) annual presentation of their economic outlook and business confidence survey, released on Thursday (Feb. 9).Hirschle said he predicts the Taiwan economy will experience a relative dip in growth in 2023, but long-term prospects remain healthy. Weak U.S. and Chinese demand for Taiwan’s exports, low consumer confidence, and Taiwan’s aging population will all impact Taiwan’s economic performance, he said.Hirschle said China is the “glimpse of hope” for the Taiwan economy in 2023, as an improvement in the Chinese economy would increase demand for Taiwan’s exports. “Economic activity seems to be picking up there, some GDP forecasts for China expect 6% GDP growth, double of last year,” he said.“The bottom line is that the stagnation of exports is quite probably and realistic, (but) maybe there might be small growth if China were to really pick up rapidly and the U.S. stabilized soon,” Hirschle said.He also said that there are positive signs coming out of the U.S., but that changes won’t come soon enough to influence Taiwan’s economic performance in 2023.“It seems clear that an easing of interest rates in the U.S. will happen at the end of the year, or in 2024, and this will be too late to influence the demand for exports made in Taiwan positively,” Hirschle said.Hirschle made his presentation following the results of the GTO survey, presented to a group of businesspeople and industry leaders by Executive Director of the GTO Axel Limberg on Thursday night. According to the survey, despite Hirschle’s somewhat gloomy prediction for 2023, German business confidence in Taiwan remains steady.Director of Taiwan and the Philippines Asia-Pacific Germany Trade & Invest Alexander Hirschle speaking at the release of the GTO 2023/2023 Business Confidence Survey on Thursday (Feb. 9). (German Trade Office in Taipei photo)Limberg said the vast majority of German companies operating in Taiwan are healthy and profitable, and that 2022 was a successful year for German businesses. “Even though 53.4% were negatively impacted during the pandemic, only a minor proportion of 5.6% damage. 20% were even able to benefit from Taiwan’s special economic conditions,” Limberg said.Limberg said that macroeconomic challenges such as disrupted supply chains caused German businesses’ revenues to decrease slightly, and had a negative impact on business sentiment. He said that this was not only true for Taiwan, but that supply chain issues affected the global economy.Limberg said that only 25% of German companies expect a further improvement of the economic situation in Taiwan. “This is a substantial change compared to last year when more than 60% of companies believed there would be an improvement,” he said.Despite this, the survey also showed that 97% of German companies currently doing business in Taiwan plan to stay, and 93% said they would start the year again.Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua (王美花) attended the event for the third year running, and expressed her thanks to German businesses at a time of increasing cross-strait tensions. She commented that the industries of Taiwan and Germany are “highly complementary.”She added the Ministry of Economic Affairs has five priorities going forward. “My ministry will work hard to grow Taiwan’s economy … which includes enhancing global competitiveness of industry, supporting SMEs, and the service sector, strengthening our infrastructure, and promoting investment in Taiwan,” she said.She also said that investments from German companies, like semiconductor firm Merck’s mega site in Kaohsiung help Taiwan maintain its leading edge in the semiconductor industry.Merck Group Taiwan’s Managing Director John Lee also spoke at the event, and was more optimistic about the prospects for Taiwan’s economy. “We are hoping that (in the fourth quarter) there will be some kind of upswing,” Lee said.He also said that innovations in Taiwan’s two main products, semiconductors and screen technology, were helping to improve sustainability. He added his company is confident it can reduce a highly carbon emitting chemical used in the semiconductor manufacturing process by 90%. Also, innovations in areas such as electronically dimmable “smart windows” are helping Taiwan to reduce and use energy more efficiently.",2023/2/10,737,Business

            Speaking at press conference in Taipei, Managing Director of Marketing David Schulte said flights to and from Taiwan have continued to grow steadily over the past couple of years and have reached 75% of pre-pandemic levels. Schulte said that looking at schedules for the rest of the year, Taiwanese airlines are adding a lot of growth to the market.

            He noted a 340% jump in flights from Taiwan to the rest of Asia this year, a 240% growth in flights to North America, and a 250% growth in flights to Europe. With Beijing lifting its border restrictions, Boeing sees air traffic between Taiwan and China recovering to 31% of pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter.

            Meanwhile, global air travel has recovered to 75% compared to 2019 levels, with North America leading the way at 92%, followed by 90% in Latin America, 89% in the Middle East, and 87% in Europe, while Asia and Oceania are at 57%. For the Asia-Pacific region, Schulte said the company expects air traffic to recover to 2019 levels in 2024/2025.











            Boeing said Northeast Asia (Taiwan, Japan, and S. Korea) will need 1,345 new airplanes by 2041, with 55% of these planes being single-aisle and 41% being widebody aircraft. Schulte pointed out that most of these aircraft deliveries will be for replacements.

            Throughout the pandemic, Boeing realized the need for dedicated freighters, especially for the Northeast Asia region, Schulte said. As the world exits the pandemic, Boeing still sees the need for dedicated freighters, but as passenger traffic recovers there will be more lower-hold belly capacity returning to the cargo market.

            Over the next 20 years, Boeing said the Asia Pacific region will account for 38% of freighter deliveries, followed by North America at 32%, Europe at 16%, and the Middle East and Africa at 9%.

            Back in 2018, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) had originally been tapped to provide chips to Flex Logic that were to be used by Boeing. However, it ended up losing the deal to Global Foundries over security concerns and tensions between the U.S. and China, according to EE Times.

            When asked by Taiwan News if Boeing would look to source chips from TSMC’s upcoming Phoenix fabs, the company said it could not say for sure now. It would continue to evaluate its suppliers to stabilize the supply chain.

The measures include slashing operational expenditure and suspending stock buybacks.A day earlier, the American chipmaker said it is cutting salaries of executives by as much as 20% and suspending bonuses, media reported.Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, PayPal, SAP, IBM, and Spotify are among the big tech companies reporting aggressive cost-cutting measures since late last year, including layoffs and executive pay cuts.In November, Micron Taiwan announced more hires locally, but the optimism quickly reversed after the company started making what are reportedly mass layoffs last week. Several people who claim to be Micron Taiwan employees posted on Dcard, Taiwan's largest online discussion forum, that they were given short notice of termination, while those being sacked were given a better-than-expected severance package.In response to the rumor, the company issued a statement saying work force streamlining will continue this year through layoffs or voluntary resignations, but it did not unveil the size of cuts in Taiwan.In Taiwan, the atmosphere among local semiconductor and tech companies is quite different. The recruitment plans of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and IBM Taiwan, for example, remain unchanged, TVBS reported.When asked about the recent layoff spree, Advantech founder KC Liu (劉克振) said Taiwanese tech companies are more capable of sustaining economic contraction when demand begins to fall, as their employee costs are lower than those of their American rivals — up to a 2.5 times difference.",2023/2/11,6998,Business

We also announce that starting today, any TikTok video-making is banned at our restaurant, and TikTok influencers are banned from entering! This is to avoid thoughtless licking.”Supporters of the decision asked for stickers from the restaurant. Others echoed the restaurant owner’s opinion of TikTok.User Ong Long Sim commented, “TikTok is not only dangerous because of cyber security (issues), censorship, and misinformation, it also harms people’s, especially adolescents’, attention span in absorbing information. Apart from hoping there will be relevant regulations to suppress it, I also support the restaurant owner’s active boycott.”Meanwhile, opponents flooded both the Fishers’ Diner’s Facebook page and Google profile with criticism and one-star reviews. “People must get their phone checked to dine at a restaurant? … Who do you think you are?” wrote Facebook user Kung Chuan.“Don’t you know the Japanese uploaded to Instagram?” commented another user named Chen Hao (陳浩).

He added that the restaurant’s staff will not be checking patrons’ phones.While Yeh knew that the Japanese diner who licked utensils at the sushi restaurant chain Sushiro had uploaded to Instagram on Twitter, he said the young man also admitted that he was imitating a “challenge” on TikTok. “Even though he uploaded to Twitter and Instagram, it started on Tiktok.”Regarding the criticism and negative reviews he received, Yeh said, “I respect freedom of speech, but using TikTok as an excuse to attack is wrong. I don’t understand why people got so political about this.” He added that he had already consulted with the restaurant’s legal counsel and is preparing to sue those who leave slanderous, one-star reviews without ever dining there.In a post published on Sunday (Feb. 12), Fishers’ Diner emphasized that its goal is to prevent “challenges” from happening at restaurants and causing trouble for others.

The center said that after Tseng died on the battlefield, Tseng’s family contacted Chiu, hoping he would hold a fundraiser for Tseng’s funeral. After discussion, the family agreed that the fundraising campaign would be hosted by another association, which was chaired by Chiu at the time.The Taiwan Center claimed that it had absorbed all the manpower costs during the campaign, had not taken a penny, and even paid for advertisements for the fund out of its own pocket.After the fundraiser began, donations poured in, and the association concluded the campaign on Nov. 25 via Facebook post in accordance with the agreement signed by the two parties.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808692,Appier records its first profitable year and forecasts profitable growth for 2023,"Achieved annual operating profit one year ahead of schedule

TAIPEI, Feb. 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- 

Highlights and achievements for fiscal year 2022  Annual revenue increased to 19.4 billion yen with a 53% YoY growth rate, surpassing previous guidance of 19.2 billion yen Full-year operating profit target reached one year ahead of schedule, with operating margins at 0.3% and improving by 9 percentage points YoY Annual gross profit accelerated to 60% YoY, with a gross margin of 51.5%, more than tripled in the last 4 years Revenue from US and EMEA markets increased over 7 times YoY and represented 12% of total revenues 

Guidance for fiscal year 2023  Forecast of 31% (34% on FX neutral basis) increase in YoY revenue growth to 25.5 billion yen and gross profit growth is expected to surpass revenue growth at 35% YoY due to further gross margin improvement. Increase in operating income by around 10 times to 535 million yen and further improve operating margin to 2.1% Continuous geographic and vertical expansion, along with ROI-driven solutions and further product synergies for better up-sell and cross-sell opportunities, to be key growth drivers in FY23 Continued growth of AI trends to drive further business growth 











Highlight and achievements of Q4 FY22  Revenue increased by 47% YoY and hit a historical high of 5.8 billion yen Annual recurring revenue YoY growth rate further increased from 46% to 53% Gross profit reached 56% YoY growth with a record-high gross profit of 3 billion yen Attained both EBITDA margin and operating margin improvement of 6 percentage points YoY Grew customers by 26% YoY, alongside a low customer churn rate of 0.62% 

Closing out the year with a stellar performance

            Appier Group Inc (TSE: 4180), henceforth referred to as Appier, today announced its fiscal and fourth-quarter earnings results for the year ended 31 December 2022. Appier closed out the fiscal year of 2022 achieving a full-year operating profit for the first time, one year ahead of schedule from its FY23 target, with a revenue increase of 53% YoY at 19.4 billion yen. This year marks growth acceleration for Appier for four years in a row, as annual gross profit more than tripled in the last four years to accelerate to 60% YoY. EBITDA margin rose to 7%, keeping the company on a strong trajectory toward its 2025 financial targets.

            Appier's strong performance was attributed to the continuous expansion of its customer base both regionally and vertically, alongside robust product synergies and successful customer retention through up-sell and cross-sell strategies. Northeast Asia (63%) continued to reach high growth despite a large revenue base, while revenues in Greater China (20%) were mainly driven by vertical growth. US and EMEA (12%) continue to be a key growth driver with a larger total addressable market (TAM), as it increased its revenue over 7 times YoY in the fiscal year.

            The company's further expansion to more diversified verticals led to stronger growth acceleration. The Digital Content (gaming, entertainment, e-books, and online streaming) vertical grew significantly with 10 percentage points YoY increase in FY22 to constitute 38% of total revenues, only second to Ecommerce (43%), then followed by Other Internet Services [1] (12%) and Consumer Brands and BFSI (7%). Strong demand from these digital-first industries will continue as they place digital strategies at the forefront of their transformation under the new normal post-COVID.

            In addition to growing the total number of customers by 26% in FY22, Appier's higher business efficiency also resulted in a higher customer Lifetime Value (LTV) at 64% YoY and a lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) at -12% YoY. The higher LTV was driven by a lower churn rate of customer revenue and higher gross profit per customer; while the lower CAC was driven by lower expenses on new customer acquisition and a higher number of net new customers. 

            The successful transfer from the Mothers segment to the Prime segment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) in December 2022 is also a significant testament to the sophisticated organization with strong growth and good corporate governance.

A strong quarter to close out a profitable year

            Appier's revenue in Q4 grew at a rate of 47% YoY to record a historical high of 5.8 billion yen, reaching a gross profit of 56% YoY growth. Operating margins reached 137 million yen, providing a strong tail end to close out a profitable fiscal year 2022. The company also retained a low customer churn rate of 0.62%.

            ""2022 has been a year of growth acceleration for Appier. We achieved full-year profitability one year ahead of schedule and tripled our revenue and gross profit in four years. These great results reflect that the market is responding well to the first-party data trends and our ROI-driven solutions powered by AI,"" said Dr. Chih-Han Yu, CEO and Co-Founder, Appier. ""2023 is an important year for exciting developments in AI. Supporting customers to gain the most value from AI trends and technologies through their digital transformation journeys remains a key priority for us. With the current trajectory that Appier is on, along with our core value of innovative technology enhancement, a customer-centric mindset, and prudent M&A approach, we are confident that we are on the right track to reach our targets this year.""

Strong business momentum for future growth

            Appier's 2023 guidance comes with forecasted annual revenue growth of 31% (34% on FX neutral basis) to reach 25.5 billion yen. The overall outlook for 2023 is optimistic, with annual gross profit growth of 35% YoY, an operating income increase of around 10 times to 535 million yen, and an EBITDA profit of 2.34 billion yen with a 72% YoY growth rate. The company also targets to achieve operating margins of 2.1% following its strong business momentum.

            Looking ahead to FY23, Appier is confident about the future. The influence of first-party data trends and new technologies in AI, alongside the company's strategic geographical and vertical expansions, and its focus on cutting-edge innovation, are set to consolidate demand for Appier's solutions that turn customers' marketing investments into measurable returns.

CECC head Victor Wang (王必勝) said that the center is leaning towards a policy of ""0+n"" for mild cases, meaning zero days of quarantine and up to seven days of self-health monitoring, depending on how soon they test negative.In addition, Wang said that the CECC is considering only reporting hospitalized patients with severe illness, while those with mild symptoms will not be officially reported.Wang explained that the inoculation of the next generation of vaccines will continue to be expanded. He pointed out that he has continued to visit various counties and cities and listened to the opinions of locals.He said that a summary of the vaccination plan for this year will soon be provided.As for the guidelines for quarantining COVID patients, Wang said that the center is looking at reducing quarantine for mild cases from ""5+n"" to ""0+n.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4808784,11 taboos for Valentine’s Day in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — When religious holidays become international affairs, like the Valentine’s Day merriment on Tuesday, Feb. 14, they often become localized and lose or even gain something in translation at the same time.While Taiwan already has a holiday of its own for star-crossed lovers, Qixi Festival on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, this does not prevent anyone from giving gifts on Valentine’s Day too. As they say, there is no such thing as too much love.Valentine’s Day has evolved in Taiwan over recent years and now looks a little different from the West, where it originated as a Christian feast day dedicated to a martyr known as Saint Valentine. Typically, abroad, lovers will send each other cards, chocolates or flowers, and have a night out a deux at a restaurant or the cinema.In Taiwan, a romantic date is par for the course, but gift giving has become a complicated affair to some extent because the words for gifts may have unfortunate double meanings or are thought to be unlucky. A recent TVBS article featuring folklore expert Yang Deng-yu (楊登嵙) addresses these faux pas for Valentine’s.Valentine's card from 1810, from Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum. (AP photo)Actually, gift giving for foreigners can be a bit of a minefield at any time of the year because of cultural misunderstandings, like white being the color of death, while black is more often associated with death in the West. The good news is cards, chocolates, and flowers (but not funeral flowers!) generally get a pass.If in doubt, ask a friend. Happy Valentine’s.",2023/2/13,7837,Society

The office immediately dispatched seven personnel from its Anmashan Workstation to investigate.The workstation personnel, along with police officers, arrived at the scene at around noon and found smoke coming out of a pile of burning wood and a number of cooking utensils on the ground. They collected evidence and waited until the hikers returned to the camp at around 3 p.m.The office said the location of the incident was a forestation site, and the wood used for the campfire was likely small-diameter logs left behind during the forestation. The tree species forested there include fir, red cypress, and cedar trees, all of which are oily trees with fragrant smells and are classified as first class conifers.If a campfire accidentally triggered a forest fire, it would cause huge losses, and would be difficult to put out, the office said, adding that starting a fire in the forest violates the Forestry Act, and according to Article 56, is punishable by a fine between NT$120,000 (US$3,960) and NT$600,000.In addition, taking wood in the forest to build a fire is considered theft and violates Article 50 of the same law, which stipulates, ""Those who steal primary forest products or forest by-products shall be liable to at least six months but no more than five years of imprisonment; in addition to a penalty of at least NT$300,000 but no more than NT$6,000,000.""If the offenses are committed on primary forest products that are regarded as precious wood, the penalty shall be increased by one half, according to the act.The case has been referred to police for further investigation, the office said.According to the office, the dry season has come, and there has been no rainfall in the central mountainous area for nearly two months.

Hsiao was coy with her answer, noting that more than 30 members of the U.S. Congress have visited Taiwan in the past year. She added that more U.S. congress members could be on their way and her office will accommodate each congressional delegation.Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Wang Ting-yu (王定宇), convener of the Legislative Yuan’s Foreign and National Defense Committee, invited Hsiao to speak with legislators on Monday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809394,Taiwan tour bus drivers in short supply according to travel industry,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The tourism industry is finally getting back to normal after two years of pandemic disruption, which has led to a shortage of tour bus drivers. 

            As travel operators around Taiwan book new tour packages for spring and summer, they are discovering a shortage of around 3,000 tour bus drivers, according to Liberty Times. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) has been made aware of the problem and promised a two-part subsidy program for tour bus drivers beginning in March.

            MOTC Minister Wang Kwo-tsai (王國材) said that the past two years have been particularly difficult for the tourist bus industry with the COVID pandemic inducing layoffs and idle fleets. In order to get back lost manpower, a special program has been crafted to encourage new drivers to enter the industry.

            The subsidized training plan will include the full payment of training fees for drivers hired by tour bus operators. Also, a daily living allowance will be provided during training to reduce the financial burden on aspiring drivers, according to MOTC Directorate General of Highways, Transportation Management Section Head Liang Kuo-Kuo(梁郭國).











            In addition, Liang outlined another subsidy plan to entice former drivers back. The plan includes the provision of cash incentives ranging between NT$30,000-NT$60,000 (US$1,000-US$2,000).

            Liang said the cash incentive plan would also begin in March, and last for exactly one year.

The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) has been made aware of the problem and promised a two-part subsidy program for tour bus drivers beginning in March.MOTC Minister Wang Kwo-tsai (王國材) said that the past two years have been particularly difficult for the tourist bus industry with the COVID pandemic inducing layoffs and idle fleets. In order to get back lost manpower, a special program has been crafted to encourage new drivers to enter the industry.The subsidized training plan will include the full payment of training fees for drivers hired by tour bus operators. Also, a daily living allowance will be provided during training to reduce the financial burden on aspiring drivers, according to MOTC Directorate General of Highways, Transportation Management Section Head Liang Kuo-Kuo(梁郭國).In addition, Liang outlined another subsidy plan to entice former drivers back. The plan includes the provision of cash incentives ranging between NT$30,000-NT$60,000 (US$1,000-US$2,000).Liang said the cash incentive plan would also begin in March, and last for exactly one year.

He said the eight-day program helped him build his list of business contacts from nothing to now employing about 20 people in Taiwan.Law recently joined Garage+ Director May Yang at the Startup Island Taiwan Podcast with host Uly Su to discuss the relevance of Taiwan to tech startups globally.Garage+ is the only overseas incubator partner of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence lab, according to Yang, and has facilitated more than 400 startups with 75% successfully securing funding. Yang said that the main goal of the startup accelerator programs is to support entrepreneurs to discover businesses, investors, and markets in Asia.During the eight-day course, Garage+ arranges one on one meetings between business partners, investors, and entrepreneurs. “We think (that’s) a very efficient way for startups to directly talk with their potential partners, buyers, or investors,” Yang said.She said for Law, his one-week program saw him attending 14 one on one meetings. “It was very intensive,” Yang said.After the course is complete, Yang said Garage+ continues to provide startups with support they need to gain a foothold in Taiwan. When Law recruited his first staff in Taiwan, they were able to work at Garage+ headquarters free for three months, a perk offered to all of the programs’ participants.Garage+ also provides extra exposure for startups after the program is over, said Yang. “When we held our MIT bi-annual symposium in 2019, our topic was related to AI, so we invited (Law) to speak and share his business in front of three hundred corporations and top executives,” she said.Law said he has joined many startup accelerator programs, but that the Garage+ program was useful because of the focus on building connections rather than just raising funds. “I think sometimes there are things that are more important than money, (such as) important business relationships, and I think Garage+ helped us a lot with that aspect.”",2023/2/14,891,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4809480,"Taiwan parents rarely have moral, religious opposition to LGBT issues: research","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwanese parents rarely have religious reasons for opposing their non-heterosexual children’s sexual orientation, and feel that increasing visibility of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people in society is reducing discrimination, according to a recent study out of the University of Hong Kong (HKU).Speaking to Taiwan News, Assistant Professor at the Department of Social Work and Social Administration HKU and author of the research Dr. Huang Yu-Te (黃昱得) said that Taiwanese parents’ concerns stem largely from anxieties about their child living in a society dominated by heterosexual norms and anti-LGBTQ stereotypes. He said that unlike in some western countries where Christian values dominate, his research shows that moral opposition to LGB people amongst parents in Taiwan is rare.“I think it’s relatively rare to hear things like ‘our religion thinks this is wrong,’"" Huang said. “The parents won’t even form their opposition on the basis of ‘right or wrong?’”Huang said that parents will more likely be concerned about the impact coming out will have on their children’s future, along with interpersonal issues. He said that respondents often spoke of concerns about how they would tell their families and friends, and how this would affect other peoples' perceptions of them and their children.“One of the main arguments I want to put forward is that our understanding of parental attitudes towards LGBT issues needs to be situated in a family context, particularly in Taiwanese society,” Huang said.Taiwanese parents’ initial reaction to their children coming out was often confusion and anxiety, according to the research paper. However, once parents were introduced to the concept that being born gay was normal, some became more accepting. “If you are wired like that, what’s the point of changing, right? I think this (idea) helped me accept fate and made me realize that my son’s sexual orientation is unchangeable,” one interviewee, a 58-year-old mother said.The research results also showed that some of the distress parents experienced when discovering their child’s sexual orientation was due to the lack of exposure to these issues throughout their lives. Huang says that greater LGBT representation in the media can help address this issue while also getting rid of pervading negative stereotypes.“One side of it would be to say that LGBT people and straight people really aren’t that different,” Huang said. “They’re students, working people, they do all the things heterosexual people do, it’s pretty much all the same. The only difference is their choice of their partner’s gender.”Secretary General of the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR) Chih-chieh Chien (簡至潔) agrees, saying that in a year, a viewer might only see 4 or 5 stories about LGBTQ+ people on mainstream Taiwan TV.Chien said many of the cultural stereotypes about LGBTQ people in Taiwan are the result of discriminatory government policy and media coverage that was common when many older Taiwanese grew up. She said between 1950-1990 it was common to read headlines suggesting homosexuality was an illness, that it was morally wrong, and that it should be stopped.Dr. Huang Yu-Te (黃昱得) says understandings of Taiwanese parental attitudes towards LGBT issues need to be situated in a family context. (Supplied, Huang Yu-Te photo)“When I was in university, the instructors would say that LGBTQ people were perverted, so (anti-LGBTQ discrimination was normal) not that long ago,” Chien said.Chien also said that continuing the family line is very important in traditional Chinese culture, so Taiwanese society will likely find it harder to accept gay people than other members of the LGBTQ+ community. “There’s research in Taiwan to show that parents will more likely accept their daughters if they are gay than their sons,” she said.According to Chien, during the early years of the LGBTQ+ rights movement, campaigners thought it best for members of the movement to avoid being overtly non-heterosexual in their appearance and attitude, and that this in turn has impacted the visibility of LGBTQ+ people in society.“Early on in Taiwan society, and in the gay movement, it wasn’t encouraged to come out of the closet,” and because of this, LGBTQ people are not presently as visible in society as they could be, Chien said.Huang said that another barrier to acceptance is the way people view the concept of discrimination, and says that people need to be aware that discrimination against LGBTQ+ people is pervasive in Taiwanese society.He said that while some believe that discrimination is defined by a verbal or physical attack, this is not the reality for many LGBT people in their everyday life.“In the research we’d often hear interviewees say ‘I don’t discriminate against them, but I don’t approve of their behavior,’” Huang said. “(In reality) your attitude toward and your treatment of LGBT people can also constitute discrimination.”",2023/2/14,2395,Society

The inmate was granted leave to visit relatives but failed to return to the prison.The escaped inmate, 27-year-old Lu Tsung-lung (魯宗龍), was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison by the Fuchien High Court Kinmen Branch Court for fraud and theft, reported ETtoday. However, because his household registration is in Hualien County, Lu was sent to the Hualien Zihciang Minimum-Security Prison to serve his sentence.Recently, Lu applied for permission to travel to his hometown in Kinmen County to visit his relatives on Saturday (Feb. 11). He was originally supposed to return to the prison at 8 p.m. on Monday (Feb. 13), but his flight was delayed due to fog.He took a later flight at 5 p.m. and arrived at Songshan Airport at 7 p.m. At the airport, he notified the prison that he would return to the prison facility and would go to Nangang Train Station to purchase a ticket to go back to Hualien.However, Lu never appeared that evening and prison staff contacted his family members, who claimed they were unaware of his whereabouts. The Ministry of Justice notified the CIB to issue a special warrant for his arrest.The killing of two police officers by an escapee from Mingde Minimum Security Prison in Tainan City shocked the public last year. Therefore, the CIB advised police officers to take precautions to ensure their own safety when searching for the inmate.Police then began reviewing surveillance camera footage and saw him getting off a plane at Songshan Airport and buying tickets at Nangang Station. Instead of buying a ticket to Hualien, Lu appeared to purchase a ticket to New Taipei City's Xizhi District.At 3 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon, police were able to pinpoint Lu's location to an internet cafe in Xizhi, reported UDN. Police arrested him on the spot and are escorting him back to Hualien.Lu had been allowed to go out on leave five times and had less than one year left on his sentence. He applied for parole in November last year, but was denied.His escape may affect his chances of being released from prison on parole in the future.",2023/2/14,2022,Society

Berkshire dumps shares in TSMC, banks; increases Apple stake
NEW YORK/BANGALORE, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) slashed its stake in Taiwanese contract chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW), as well as in some banks in the fourth quarter, while bolstering its holdings in Apple Inc (AAPL.O).
Berkshire cut its position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) by 86.2% to 8.29 million sponsored American depositary shares, according to a regulatory filing.
This comes roughly three months after Berkshire unveiled it bought more than $4.1 billion worth of TSMC stock, which sent shares of the world's largest contract chipmaker soaring.
TSMC depository receipts fell 4% in U.S. after hours trade on Tuesday. In Taiwan, TSMC shares opened down 3.3% as Asian markets started Wednesday trading.
Depositary shares in TSMC, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, have surged almost 32% this year, closing at $97.96 on Tuesday.
""Berkshire made a small profit on TSMC. It was not a huge, huge win for Berkshire,"" said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst. According to her calculations, Berkshire bought it for roughly $68.5 and sold for $74.5.
It is rare but not unprecedented for Berkshire to quickly undo a multi-billion dollar investment in a company's stock. In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire sold nearly all of what had been an $8.3 billion stake in Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) that it amassed in late 2020.
TSMC last month said revenue in the first quarter is likely to dip 5% as it weathers a global downturn in the chip industry because of softening consumer demand for electronics. TSMC executives have said they do not expect market conditions to improve until the second half of the year.
Besides TSMC, Buffett also divested 91.4% of its shares in US Bancorp (USB.N), to 6.7 million shares, and shrunk its stake in BNY Mellon by roughly 60%, to 25.1 million shares. Both cuts totaled nearly $5.5 billion at current prices.
Buffett's conglomerate also holds shares in Citigroup Inc (C.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Jefferies (JEF.N).
Berkshire trimmed some positions across its portfolio of U.S. listed companies, including Chevron (CVX.N), Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), maker of the ""Call of Duty"" video game, and Kroger (KR.N).
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is making efforts to conclude the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. On Feb. 21, Microsoft will defend the deal in front of European Union and national antitrust officials at a closed hearing.
Among Berkshire's few additions are Apple, which Buffett views more as a consumer products company. Berkshire bought another 20.8 million Apple shares worth $3.2 billion, raising its stake to 5.8%, according to the filing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4810589,TSMC founder told Pelosi US semiconductor plans 'naive',"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacting Co. (TSMC) founder Morris Chang (張忠謀) told Nancy Pelosi that U.S. plans to spend its way into the semiconductor manufacturing industry were “incredibly naïve” during her August trip to Taiwan, according to reports.According to Politico, Pelosi and Chang were at a luncheon at the Presidential Office when Chang began to voice doubts about the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, and the planned multi-billion package of subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing.“Fifty billion dollars – well, that’s a good start,” Chang said in front of an audience that included President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), according to the Politico report. He then went on to press Pelosi with questions, including asking whether or not the U.S. plans represented a genuine commitment to building a globally competitive semiconductor industry, or simply an “impulsive” move to enter a lucrative global market.Chang reportedly explained to Pelosi that establishing a viable semiconductor industry would require more than a one-off cash injection due to the rapid pace at which the industry evolves. He said that once an industry was established, simply obtaining the raw materials needed was an enormous task, and that the task of making the chips was almost “impossibly complicated.”Chang reportedly then said that if the U.S. truly wanted to guarantee security of its semiconductor supply, it should continue to invest in Taiwan’s national security, as TSMC had “long perfected” what America was now trying to establish.Pelosi was reportedly untroubled by the remarks, though acknowledged that other Taiwanese executives expressed reservations about the U.S. plan during the meeting. They specifically questioned whether or not the U.S. environmental and labor laws were sufficient to support such a complicated industry.President Joe Biden talks about bringing chip manufacturing jobs to America after touring the upcoming TSMC facility in the U.S. in Dec. 2022. (AP photo)Washington is also increasing incentives for Taiwan to expand its semiconductor manufacturing operations in the U.S., with TSMC announcing plans to up their investment in Arizona to US$40 billion (NT$1.2 trillion) in December 2022, with a further US$3.5 billion capital injection approved by the TSMC board on Tuesday (Feb. 14). TSMC is planning to have the first Phoenix fab (4nm) ready for commercial production in 2024, while it has also begun construction of a second 3nm fab which is slated to be finished in 2026.The CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) and Science Act was signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden in 2022, allocating approximately US$52 billion of subsidies to semiconductor research and manufacturing. The increase in funding comes alongside sweeping U.S. sanctions and controls on the export of semiconductor technology to China, announced in October, which are already impacting Chinese companies.Semiconductors are crucial for developing military hardware, and renewed U.S. interest in semiconductors is seen as part of a move to contain China’s military capabilities.",2023/2/15,3061,Business

The first implored the Dutch government to use all possible means to enhance ties between Taiwan and the Netherlands. The second extended support for Taiwan by all possible diplomatic means.An invitation by Dutch parliamentarians reflects concerns about China's growing power in Asia and its rising hostilities directed at Taiwan.

This was the first time Taiwan legislators entered the halls of the Dutch parliament.During the visit, Dutch parliamentarians expressed a high degree of concern about Chinese leader Xi Jinping's (習近平) regime and the possible impact upon Taiwan. Other matters were also discussed, such as Taiwan's defense capabilities, and semiconductor cooperation between Taiwan, the Netherlands, and Europe.Chiu, who headed the delegation of Taiwanese legislators, delivered a brief speech thanking the Dutch parliament for passing six resolutions supporting Taiwan since 2019. Chiu hoped for deepening cooperation in national security and science and technology. He also extended an offer to host this group should they want to personally experience Taiwan's freedom and democracy, per CNA.Both sides emphasized the importance of peace across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan was also encouraged to improve its self-defense capabilities. Taiwan legislators responded by noting a number of budget increases bolstering military and defensive capabilities, preventing China from misjudging defensive capabilities.The invitation made to Taiwan legislators by the Dutch House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee occurred only after special discussion. Under normal circumstances, the parliamentary body would not have time to meet with foreign delegations as it would be focused on deciding its upcoming legislative agenda.Since 2019, the Dutch House of Representatives of the Netherlands passed numerous motions to support Taiwan’s international participation in the World Health Organization (WHO), Interpol, and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).",2023/2/15,450,Politics

Rejoining the party in time to qualify for an upcoming primary will be difficult as party rules dictate a minimum waiting period of four years, with Guo needing to wait till September.According to a UDN report, Gou has reached out to KMT Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) to discuss the matter. Former KMT Secretary-General Lee Chien-lung (李乾龍) said party rules need to be followed when evaluating Gou’s potential return to the KMT, and consequent participation in party primaries.To deal with his predicament, Gou was spotted traveling to the offices of former Legislative President Wang Jin-pyng (王金平) on Tuesday (Feb. 14). The two met in private for approximately one hour, with Gou potentially strategizing a quick return to the KMT for the purpose of participating in the party’s primary.As it stands now, Gou’s application to return to the party would be too late to qualify for participation in the KMT primaries for the 2024 presidential election. However, there is a chance the KMT Party Central Committee could formulate special measures to relax regulations restoring party membership or relevant nomination regulations.New Taipei City Mayor Hou You-yi (侯友宜) is the presumed frontrunner in the party’s primary, though he has yet to announce his candidacy for the presidency. Hou has also benefitted from the support of KMT Chairman Eric Chu, who has repeatedly praised him as one of the strongest and dependable members of the KMT.As for whether Gou will be able to wiggle himself back into the party through the back door, this is a matter that still requires observation.

Hathaway’s share dump follows Tiger Global Management, GQG Partners and Capital Group, BlackRock Inc, as well as JPMorgan & Chase all making significant reductions in their TSMC holdings, according to reports.The 2023 export outlook for Taiwan may have contributed to the selloff. Weak U.S. and Chinese demand for Taiwan’s exports, and low consumer confidence are all expected to impact the Taiwan’s economic performance over the remainder of 2023.The move has taken some investors by surprise, as Buffett is famously a “long term” investor, though one Taiwanese economist said the move has been misunderstood. Director of President Capital Management (統一投顧) Li Fang-kuo (黎方國) said that although it is widely believed that Buffett is a long-term investor, more than one third of his holdings will be sold off every quarter or two.Despite TSMC’s own prediction that sales will drop this quarter, it is continuing with construction of multiple fabs in the U.S. and Japan, while it also increased investment to US$40 billion for its Arizona operations in December, with a further US$3.5 billion capital injection approved by the TSMC board on Tuesday (Feb. 14).TSMC is planning to have the first Phoenix facility (4nm) ready for commercial production in 2024, while it has also begun construction of a second 3nm fab which is slated to be finished in 2026.Buffett’s mass withdrawal and the 2023 economic outlook aside, long term growth prospects for TSMC and the global semiconductor industry remain healthy, with some predicting an over 12% increase in the market by 2029.

            The expanded regiment, previously the 12th Marine Regiment, was agreed upon by the U.S. and Japan following the 2023 U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee meeting in January, according to the U.S. Naval Institute. The unit is expected to be formed by 2025 and will have “advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as anti-ship and transportation capabilities,” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said during the meeting.

            The regiment would be able to island hop undetected to carry out various missions, including intelligence-gathering and anti-ship missile operations, in the region.











            Additionally, Berger said loitering munitions could play a role in blocking enemy access to strategic chokepoints by sea, Nikkei cited him as saying.

The question asked by the survey was “If a Chinese spy balloon enters Taiwan’s airspace, should the nation’s military do as the U.S. military, and shoot down the object?”The results of the survey, released on Friday (Feb. 17), follow the news of Chinese spy balloons reported over North and Central America in recent weeks. While a majority of respondents agreed that Chinese spy balloons should be shot down, 14% of respondents expressed uncertainty, with 7% saying they did not know, and another 7% saying they had no opinion on the matter.The survey was conducted among adults over 20 years of age, over the course of two days, from Feb. 13 to Feb. 14.

            Hardware sales and other revenues for Q4 were US$64.1 million, down 32.1% from a year earlier. Gogoro noted a 25.6% decline year-over-year in the fourth quarter for the entire two-wheeler market in Taiwan.

            Meanwhile, electric scooter sales were down 30.4% compared to the same quarter last year, which the company attributed to a larger than normal quantity of scooter sales in Q4 2021 due to various government and market incentives.

The company said that continued growth in Gogoro Network revenue and revenue from Gogoro branded scooters, component kits for OEMs, batteries, and swapping stations for overseas partners was offset by a weaker Taiwan two-wheeler market last year, when total scooter sales were down 9.3% year-on-year, while electric scooter sales dropped 6.7% compared to 2021.

Gogoro said it had a US$236.1 million cash balance at the end of 2022, and in addition to the available credit facilities, is well positioned for short- and longer-term capital needs.

            Looking ahead to full year 2023, the company said it expects revenue of US$400 to US$450 million, which represents a forecast increase of 4.5% to 17.6% compared to 2022. Gogoro added that it expects to generate 90-95% of 2023 full year revenue from the Taiwan market.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwanese electric two-wheeler maker and swappable battery infrastructure provider Gogoro announced financial results for its fourth quarter and 12 months ending on Dec. 31, 2022 on Thursday (Feb. 16).Gogoro reported fourth quarter revenue of US$95.5 million (NT$2.90 billion), representing a 20.8% year-on-year decline.

Gogoro noted a 25.6% decline year-over-year in the fourth quarter for the entire two-wheeler market in Taiwan.Meanwhile, electric scooter sales were down 30.4% compared to the same quarter last year, which the company attributed to a larger than normal quantity of scooter sales in Q4 2021 due to various government and market incentives.Gogoro Network revenue for Q422 was US$31.4 million, up 19.5% from a year prior.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4813318,Turkish TV star Wu Feng on Taiwan's response to Turkey earthquake,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwanese-Turkish TV show host Ugur Rifat Karlova, better known as Wu Feng (吳鳳), has spoken about the Taiwanese response to the devastating 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake, the reaction to Taiwanese aid in Turkey, and how people in Taiwan can help out now.During the interview with Taiwan News, Karlova said that to reciprocate for previous help by Turkish teams during a massive local earthquake, Taiwan was one of the first to send a search and rescue team. He said that people in Turkey were touched by the generous aid donations by Taiwanese.Karlova explained that he decided to take part in a religious pilgrimage in Taiwan at this time to generate positive energy for his country in its time of need. He said that although his hometown is far from the epicenter of the quake, he still has many friends and acquaintances who were affected.What has been the response in Taiwan to the earthquake in Turkey?First of all, when Taiwanese people received information about the earthquake in Turkey, they really wanted to help. Because Taiwanese really know about earthquakes.In 1999, there was a very big earthquake in Taiwan. In Chinese, they call it the ""921 earthquake."" At that time a Turkish rescue team came to Taiwan to help save people.So, after this earthquake, Taiwanese people said, ""It's our turn, now we're going to help your country."" And they kept asking me questions such as ""how can we help, what can we do?""Even the government started to make plans to help Turkey. After the first day, Taiwan had already sent 130 rescue team members to Turkey.Taiwan was one of the first and fastest rescue teams to arrive in the earthquake zone. It shows that Taiwanese people really care a lot about Turkey's earthquake.What has been the reaction in Turkey to the Taiwan rescue and relief efforts?Wow, every day I heard many things about the Taiwanese team because Turkish media, for the first time, reported so much news about Taiwan. The first thing is, the rescue team has already saved two lives from the collapsed debris.And also, they got a lot of attention from other media organizations. So, Taiwanese people got much attention from Turkish media and also the Turkish people.I sent much news from Taiwan to Turkey and Turkish people would ask me the same question: ""Taiwan and Turkey are two different places, and we have an 8,000 km distance (separating us), how and why do Taiwanese people help us that much?""It's not a country next to Turkey, it's not on the border, so Taiwanese efforts, love, and care really surprised Turkish people. The Taiwanese government already sent US$2.2 million. Then, Taiwanese people raised, almost US$30 million, it's like half of the American government's budget (allocated to Turkey).The American government gave Turkey US$60 million, but this money came from the government. But Taiwanese people sent to Turkey US$30 million.Also, our Turkish office started to make a campaign to donate clothes, donate some materials that are needed in the earthquake zone. Taiwanese people donated 200 tons of clothes and the Turkish representative office said, ""Thank you very much, we don't have enough storage.""Our representative, said, ""I never thought we would get that many donations!"" Everybody was shocked, including me. I know Taiwanese were going to help Turkey, but it was beyond all limits.The storage area was full of items and materials. Thank you very much Taiwanese people.What inspired you to go on the Baishatun Mazu pilgrimage?I really like Taiwan's events, like temple events. I love the local culture of Taiwan. I had been planning to make it, but after the earthquake occurred, I said to myself, ""This is for Turkey!""In Taiwan, as you know, people like to seek peace and safety, they like peace and harmony. I decided this time that I am going to tell Mazu ""Turkey needs peace and Turkey needs harmony.""I joined the event with thousands of people and that atmosphere was also very touching because every Taiwanese person said the same thing, ""Wu Feng, go Turkey. We are praying for Turkey!""I could feel that even in that place, Taiwanese people were praying for Turkey, that was a very meaningful thing from Taiwan.Do you have any family or friends who have been affected by the quake?Yes, I have many friends who have been affected. I live very far away from this place because the earthquake occurred in Kahramanmaras Province. It's in the southeast part of Turkey, almost 1,000 km away from my city, I'm very close to Istanbul.I don't have any family there, but I have many friends. Among my friends, some of them have lost their family members.For example, a wife of one my friends said her sister's boyfriend passed away because of the earthquake, and they were planning to marry. In Danshui, there is a guy from Kahramanmaras City who sells Turkish ice cream, he lost eight or 10 family members.This earthquake was a very massive earthquake. There was one magnitude 7.8 earthquake and nine hours later, there was another earthquake that was magnitude 7.6.The size of the earthquake, the area, is two or three times bigger than Taiwan. Think about it, an earthquake happens in Taipei, but kills people in Nantou, Taichung, Kaohsiung, and even further. It was a really massive earthquake and one of the biggest in Turkish history.What are the greatest needs, and what can people in Taiwan do to help out now?Actually, Taiwanese people helped a lot. They sent many materials, and they donated a lot of money. We need tents, we need blankets, and we need clothes for winter, because Turkey is now going through winter and it's very cold.In the evening, it's like minus 3 to 4 degrees Celsius and sometimes it's snowing, so we need things for winter. This is very important.We need prefabricated houses, that is the kind of thing we are looking for. Taiwanese people can still donate money to local NGOs.For example, they can donate to Ahbap, which is a very famous team working for Turkey. They can donate to AKUT which is also a search and rescue team.They can donate to other NGOs, or they can donate via the UN Crisis Relief webpage for the Turkey-Syria Earthquake. This is time to help Turkey and I want to share this message to Taiwanese people and all people because Turkey is looking for more help and support from around the world.",2023/2/18,1314,Society

Qian’s family initially sought a NT$11.65 million payout from the Kaohsiung Public Works Bureau, who denied fault and said that Chinese people were not eligible for compensation under Taiwan’s national compensation laws, the Liberty Times reported.Kaohsiung District Court said this was not true, and Ch'ien’s family were eligible for compensation because Chinese people are also citizens of the Republic of China, Taiwan, by law. The judge ordered the Public Works Bureau to pay the Qian family NT$4.63 million in compensation, a decision the bureau can appeal.Qian was found on Aug. 18 2018, lying on the ground with no heartbeat. First aid was administered by passersby, but he died before reaching the hospital. One of the passersby reportedly also felt electricity coming from the lamp post that killed Ch'ien, saying that while her father was helping the man her arm felt numb.Court proceedings revealed the lamp post in question had been reported as leaking electricity six months before the incident, but was not repaired.

            Given all the fruitful results of bilateral cooperation, including in economy, trade, and culture, and the potential areas of partnership, any change to diplomatic relations with Taiwan would be “irrational and reckless,” Abdo said at a press conference.

            As the president is serving out his last term, there are talks of Paraguay dropping Taiwan in favor of China ahead of general elections in April. Opposition party candidate Efrain Alegre has vowed to break off ties with Taiwan in order to open up Paraguay to China’s massive soy and beef markets if he is elected.

            Commenting on this matter, Abdo said that from a rational, realistic, and historical perspective, Taiwan and Paraguay have had 65 years of friendly interactions. “I don’t believe anyone would want to alter this relationship,” he said, adding that relations between Paraguay and Taiwan have been steadfast under his administration.











            Under his presidency, Abdo said he has striven to deepen and strengthen the strategic alliance and partnership between the two nations. Paraguay has only ever had diplomatic ties with Taiwan, he said.

            Paraguay is a global leader of clean, renewable energy, Abdo said, revealing the country is planning cooperation with Taiwan in EV technology. Taiwanese EV-related businesses have begun expansion into the Paraguayan and regional markets, he said.

            He also expressed hope for more collaboration in food products and to see more Taiwanese business investments in South America via Paraguay.

            Abdo thanked Taiwan for providing scholarships to Paraguayan students, noting that there are 330 nationals studying in Taiwan to learn Mandarin and better understand the Taiwan work culture. In the future, if Taiwanese businesses want to move to Paraguay, these scholarship recipients will be the best resource to make the process go smoothly, he said.

            The president is wrapping up a trip to Taiwan. He arrived on Feb. 14 and met with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and other senior government officials to discuss bilateral cooperation and issues of common concern.

It is classed as a developing country, with a nominal GDP that is just under 15% of Taiwan’s at US$5,616 (NT$170,660).The Paraguayan economy is based largely on soy, maize, and beef production, having overcome the issue of having a mostly black-market economy based on drugs, weapons, and illicit electronics products in the early 2000s.Taiwan and Paraguay are about as physically far away from one another on the globe as two countries could be. Despite that, Taiwan has provided significant development assistance to the South American nation since it established bi-lateral relations in 1957 in the form of loans, technical assistance, and funding for various development projects.Paraguay’s presidential electionDespite Paraguay’s repeated commitments to its relationship with Taiwan, there may be trouble on the horizon.As the only South American country to formally conduct formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, Paraguay-Taiwan relations are constantly threatened by the prospect of the former switching recognition to China.One key factor in this is Paraguay’s upcoming presidential election and the ruling Colorado Party’s main opposition candidate, Efrain Alegre. Alegre has stated that he will sever ties with Taiwan and switch to recognition of China if he wins the election in April this year.While historical trends would indicate this is unlikely (the Colorado Party has been in power for all but five of the past 77 years) his government has recently been plagued by allegations of corruption and complaints from the soy and beef industries about lack of access to the Chinese market.Santiago Pena, presidential candidate for the ruling Colorado Party, and Efrain Alegre, his opponent, who said he will cut ties with Taiwan if elected in April this year. (Reuters photo)""We make a sacrifice for the political support given to Taiwan and on balance, we consider that we receive very little in compensation,"" Pedro Galli, president of the Rural Association of Paraguay, told Reuters.These issues are part of an ongoing discussion in Paraguay about the opportunity cost of maintaining relations with Taiwan at the expense of a relationship with China. A 2021 study estimated the opportunity cost of recognizing Taiwan for Paraguay is about 1% of the country’s total GDP in aid funding alone.Alegre has stood in the past two presidential elections and was beaten by the incumbent Abdo in 2018 by less than 4% of the vote. That was, however, before the majority of the corruption allegations against the ruling party surfaced.In addition to the upcoming election, in September last year the Financial Times reported that Abdo requested US$1 billion in Taiwanese investment to maintain diplomatic relations, though Abdo later denied that there was any “quid pro quo” for the Paraguay-Taiwan relationship,US interest in status quoEven as U.S. domestic politics becomes increasingly polarized, support for Taiwan maintains healthy bi-partisan support, and helping to maintain Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic relationships is a key method for Washington to protect its strategic interests.In 2019, Mike Pompeo made the first visit to Paraguay of any sitting U.S. secretary of state in more than 50 years, and cited the country’s relationship with Taiwan as evidence that South American countries are pushing back against “external meddling”.“Countries like Paraguay, meanwhile, are (standing) up for their own interests and beliefs by supporting a democratic Taiwan,” he said.",2023/2/18,1095,Politics

He said that the company’s initial hook was providing cat owners with information about the cat’s breed, just as 23andMe tells consumers about their ancestry composition, but has since directed its attention to cat health, which was always Kao’s intention.“We look at certain health markers, certain genetic mutations that your cat might have, that are associated with known diseases” Kao said. “We can tell you, for example, if your cat might develop a kidney disease, and if we do, you might have to change its diet, or take your cat to the vet more often to get tests done.”Basepaws also does tests on cats’ oral microbiome, looking at all the different bacteria and elements that are in there. “By looking at the different compositions of these microbes in the cat’s mouth we’re able to provide a risk for dental disease, or paradental disease, or tooth reabsorption, or a host of other diseases,” Kao said.Kao said that he is particularly excited about his company’s plans to extend testing to systemic diseases also. “When you think about the oral microbiome you think about dental diseases obviously, but we are starting to see some signals that associate the oral microbiome with kidney disease, heart disease,” Kao said.Kao said that while this kind of science is not particularly new, and has been done on humans for some time, Basepaws is hoping to expand upon the existing knowledge with their data.Kao said that the genetic testing market for dogs was already quite big, but there were few to none operating in the cat space and that Basepaws was the first. He puts this down to two reasons; historical elements, and the availability of resources.“Dog ownership and dog breeding, and the whole industry around dogs is just a lot older,” Kao said. “(There are) kennel clubs all over the world, dog breeding for specific traits has been going on for a long time (and) there’s actually a lot of money in it.In 2022, Basepaws was acquired by the company Zoetis, a globally leading animal healthcare company. “We were immediately drawn to their passion for pets and the role that genetic testing and data analytics can have in advancing animal care,” Zoetis CEO Kristin Peck said at the time.",2023/2/18,241,Business

The top diplomats of the two superpowers met at an undisclosed location on the sidelines of a global security conference in Munich, just hours after Wang scolded Washington as ""hysterical"" in a running dispute over the U.S. downing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon.
Relations between the two countries have been fraught since Washington said China flew a spy balloon over the continental U.S. before American fighter jets shot it down on President Joe Biden's orders. The dispute also came at a time when the West is closely watching Beijing's response to the Ukraine war.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday morning on NBC News' ""Meet the Press with Chuck Todd,"" Blinken said the United States was very concerned that China is considering providing lethal support to Russia and that he made clear to Wang that ""would have serious consequences in our relationship.""
""There are various kinds of lethal assistance that they are at least contemplating providing, to include weapons,"" Blinken said, adding that Washington would soon release more details.
Speaking to reporters in a briefing call, a senior State Department official said China was trying to ""have it both ways"" by claiming it wants to contribute to peace and stability but at the same time taking ""concerning"" steps to support Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""(The) secretary was quite blunt in warning about the implications and consequences of China providing material support to Russia or assisting Russia with systematic sanctions evasion,"" the senior official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Russia and China signed a ""no limits"" partnership last February shortly before Russian forces invaded Ukraine, and their economic links have boomed as Moscow's connections with the West have shriveled.
The West has been wary of China's response to the Ukraine war, with some warning that a Russian victory would color China's actions toward Taiwan. China has refrained from condemning the war or calling it an ""invasion.""
Earlier, speaking at a panel at the conference, Wang reiterated a call for dialogue and suggested European countries ""think calmly"" about how to end the war.

The group, led by Li Xiaodong (李驍東), was ostensibly invited by Mayor Chiang Wan-an (蔣萬安) to view lantern displays in Taipei to help improve cross-strait ties.Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) previously announced that the TAO delegation’s activity while in Taiwan will be closely monitored and that an initial itinerary was approved in advance of their arrival.However, questions have been raised about discrepancies in the group’s schedule and the conduct of the Taipei City Government. The group was expected to spend several hours viewing lantern displays on Saturday afternoon, but finished their tour several hours early.LTN reported that the delegation’s itinerary was changed at the last minute by the city government without public notice. In a Facebook post, DPP legislator Lin Chun-hsien (林俊憲) called for the Chiang administration to be more forthcoming about the activities of the Chinese TAO delegation, given the potential national security threat that the group represents.

“What did the group do during this lost time? Were there matters being discussed at some secretive meeting?” asked Lin. He also observed that, even if it were a delegation from an allied nation, the central government would never let such a discrepancy take place. He urged the Taipei City Government to explain how this could occur with a delegation representing China, the country that poses the greatest threat to Taiwan.DPP Taipei City Councilor Ho Meng-hua (何孟樺) posted a three-day itinerary for the group on Facebook on Friday (Feb. 17), which was likely the one approved by the MAC. Ho claimed that Mayor Chiang feared making the itinerary public due to the possibility of protests in Taipei.In a second Facebook post, Ho accused the Taipei City Government of deceiving the public in regards to the Chinese delegation and their activities in Taiwan. Despite the MAC having already approved a detailed itinerary submitted days in advance, city officials were claiming the itinerary was “still under discussion” on Saturday morning, less than an hour before the TAO delegation arrived.“Did Chiang Wan-an secretly meet with the Shanghai delegation and discuss highly sensitive issues related to national sovereignty?” Ho asked in her Facebook post.The city government has so far refused to release any records of communications between city officials and the TAO delegation, reported LTN. After approval for the visitors was granted by the Tsai administration, city officials said they would adhere to the guidelines outlined by the MAC, to keep the visit “low-key, simple, and safe.”The MAC previously announced that the TAO delegation’s activity in Taiwan will be closely monitored.

If passed by the legislature on Tuesday (Feb. 21), the fund will be partly used for the new monthly pass policy.According to the plan, those living in Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung, and Taoyuan will be able to enjoy a NT$1,200 monthly pass. They can take unlimited rides across the region’s public transportation networks, including buses, intercity buses, metro systems, Taiwan Railway, and public bicycles, per Liberty Times.For the central and southern parts of the country, the monthly pass is likely to be priced at no more than NT$1,000 as there are relatively fewer public transportation choices. The central region will comprise Taichung, Changhua, and Nantou, while the south involves Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung.The measure will be implemented for three years before new arrangements are made depending on future planning, the report quoted officials as saying.

CECC head Victor Wang (王必勝) said at a press conference if there is a violation, authorities will first attempt persuasion before imposing punishment for those who do not follow regulations.When asked by the media to respond to reports the Taipei Metro will fine passengers up to NT$15,000 for not wearing a mask, Wang said the requirement has been in place for 881 days and is not a new measure. Wang said that if there is a violation, the competent authority designated by the local government will deal with the situation and mete out punishment.He said that because Taiwan has entered an era of self-initiated epidemic prevention, it is only necessary to issue penalties in the case of ""malicious violations.""Department of Navigation and Aviation Director-General Ho Shu-ping (何淑萍) emphasized that from now on, people who take public transportation must still wear masks while in mass transit vehicles and stations. Examples include railway carriages, MRT cars, cable cars, ferries, city buses, intercity buses, tour buses, aircraft, taxis, and other means of transport, as well as stations and ferry terminals.As for stations, Ho said that masks must be worn in ticketing areas for trains and the MRT, restricted areas in airports, and ticketing and restricted areas of ferry terminals. If people in these locations must eat, drink, take photos, or undergo medical treatment, Ho said they can temporarily remove their masks.However, Ho said that those who fail to heed instructions to wear masks on public transport will be subject to a fine of between NT$3,000 and NT$15,000 in accordance with Article 70, Item 1 of the Communicable Disease Control Act (傳染病防治法).Given that Taiwan is preparing to open up to cruise ships in March, the media asked whether masks will be required inside cruise ships and on their decks.

Following that, the other ships provided access only on some days for a limited time, as short as 15 minutes.“Fishers who often spend months at sea need to be able to communicate with family, labor unions, advocates, health and other service providers, recruitment agencies, and state officials,” said Father Yance, Director of the Stella Maris Seafarers Center, a Jesuit group advocating for migrant laborers based in Kaohsiung.The Secretary General of Taiwan Association for Human Rights (TAHR) Yi-Hsiang Shih (施逸翔) said that the fishers’ lack of Wi-fi conflicts with Taiwan’s often touted democratic values.“Taiwan prides itself on being a regional leader in democratic governance and respect for human rights, however, some workers — like migrant fishers — have no way to protect their rights while they are at sea making huge profits for the seafood industry and contributing to the Taiwanese economy,” said Shih.Indonesian fisher Andris Nabeleng said that for people like him, employers not paying wages is a common problem. “Guaranteed Wi-Fi communication would ensure we get paid and that we can communicate with our union if there is a problem,” he said.In a statement released in November 2022, the Fisheries Agency of the Department of Agriculture said that it would provide subsidies of NT$3 million (US$99,000) for the purchase of equipment and monthly payments of NT$8000 for subscription fees, per ship.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816591,Migrant workers in Taiwan protest 'discriminatory' border policy,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A group of migrant workers and activists gathered on Monday (Feb. 20) outside Taiwan’s Executive Yuan to protest what they call discriminatory entry restrictions that apply only to them.Migrant workers reported border reentry issues that do not affect white-collar migrant workers, students, and business visitors who hold an Alien Residence Permit (ARC), who can currently enter Taiwan under the “0+7” epidemic prevention scheme.Most ARC holding migrant workers are still required to book seven days stay in a designated quarantine hotel, and those who are not must upload evidence of having a single room with a separate bathroom available for quarantine to a government website prior to entry. All migrant workers must also apply for a separate reentry permit.Tommie, a migrant factory worker in Taoyuan from the Philippines, said that the cost of the quarantine hotel, fees, and plane ticket amounted to two months of his basic salary (about NT$25,000 or US$820 per month), which was unaffordable. He also said that he did not use his hotel for the full seven days, but was denied a refund because he had not purchased an additional insurance policy.“I only used the hotel for two days, but my broker said I cannot refund the hotel payment…,” Tommie said. “(These) kind of rules (are the) broker taking advantage (of us) to earn more money from the migrant worker.”In a statement released on Monday (Feb. 20), the Ministry of Labor said that restrictions on migrant workers were the same as Taiwan nationals or tourists entering the country from Southeast Asia.Wu Jing-ru (吳靜如), a researcher from the Taiwan International Workers Association (TIWA), said that this was not accurate, and that the process migrant workers and returning Taiwanese from Southeast Asia have to go through is fundamentally different.“It is called a common process, but in detail, every step is different from the others’, like tourists or local people,” Wu said. She pointed to the fact that unlike others entering the country from the same regions, migrant workers have to first upload evidence of a suitable quarantine facility, and apply for reentry permits.Despite home quarantine being an option, Wu says that most migrant workers do not have access to a single private room that has its own bathroom, and they still have to show evidence of where they will stay, regardless of the chosen option, something no other ARC holders have to do. “If family members come back from abroad, they do not have to do this, so why should there be this special kind of regulation and discrimination toward migrant workers,” Wu said.Yvonne, also from the Philippines, is an elder care worker, and said she felt in practice the quarantine system is not effective for preventing the spread of COVID. She said that a swab test was all that was required to leave the quarantine hotel during the seven-day period, rendering the whole exercise pointless.Yvonne said that both she and her employer spent a lot of time and money adhering to the government rules, and that it was not only discriminatory to her, but her employer too.Wu said that while TIWA does help some migrant workers navigate these issues, the Mandarin language only government websites mean nearly all of migrant workers rely on their employers or brokers, who often charge high fees. The majority are not aware help is available, so they can not access it.Wu does not think the government has any plans to change these regulations any time soon. “Since they put out this press release saying that its all the same (for incoming tourists and migrant workers,) I don’t think they plan to,” she said.The Ministry of Labor statement said that between October 2022 and February, over 100,000 migrant workers had entered the country, returning to pre-pandemic levels.",2023/2/21,4626,Society

Taiwan’s rapidly aging population means demand for healthcare and cost-effective diagnostic devices is growing fast.The app was spearheaded by Yuan Ze University’s Department of Electrical Engineering and AI Research Center Professor Chao Yao-keng (趙燿庚), in collaboration with U.S. firm Qualcomm’s Taiwan R&D Program, and psychiatrists at Far Eastern Memorial Hospital in New Taipei.Zhao said that the deterioration of the brain caused by dementia is irreversible, the cost of care is high, and current testing methods often overlook early onset symptoms. He said that the app is cheap, fast, and simple to use, and that these features make it important for identifying the disease early and reducing the damage it causes.The research team used over 1,500 input video clips to train the AI model, with each video ranging from five to 30 minutes. Zhao said that the process of training the model to capture indicators of dementia onset (e.g. facial features, eye, and lip movement) is very resource intensive, and that this was one of the main difficulties encountered when developing the app.Despite this, Zhao said that the app had an accuracy of 80%. In the future it is planned that the app will be developed for automatic detection, or as an auxiliary tool for self-diagnosis before medical professionals are involved.Researchers say that mild cognitive impairment is considered a transitional stage between a healthy brain and a state of dementia, such as Alzheimer’s Disease. About 50% of mild cognitive impairment sufferers will deteriorate to a state of dementia within five years, according to research.",2023/2/22,284,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817804,Taiwan official apologizes over egg shortage,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Council of Agriculture Minister Chen Chi-chung (陳吉仲) on Tuesday (Feb. 21) apologized over the recent shortage of eggs and vowed efforts to boost industry resilience.Foxconn founder Terry Guo (郭台銘), who is rumored to have his eyes on the presidential race, lambasted the government on Tuesday for failing to solve the “egg crisis.”While offering his apologies for customers complaining about inadequate egg supplies, Chen Chi-chung explained that the latest egg strain could be attributed to multiple factors. He laid out the action being taken to address the woes and asked for understanding.According to Chen, avian influenza driven by the H5N1 strain is sweeping the globe, having affected more than 6,500 breeding farms. Culls are being conducted on a large scale in Taiwan, the U.S., France, Japan, South Korea, and beyond, exacerbating the availability of chickens.Previously, Taiwan saw a daily demand of 100,000 to 110,000 carts of eggs, each containing 200 units. The need has increased over the past four years to 120,000 carts, presenting a gap as the country is currently only able to produce 113,000 carts on a daily basis, he said.The country is seeking to stabilize the stock of chickens with continued imports and measures to cushion the impact of the rise in the cost of feed or diseases such as avian flu. A type of evaporative cooling system, for example, will be promoted to cut the risk of illness spreading in Taiwan’s poultry houses through better airflow.To that end, Chen said an upgrade of chicken farm facilities is being implemented to create a more sustainable, resilient egg industry.Some McDonald’s Taiwan stores have temporarily halted the sale of items including egg burgers and muffins as ""the sales have exceeded expectations."" Retailers from PX Mart to Carrefour are also restricting the number of egg cartons for each purchase.Taiwan experienced a similar egg shortage last year due to lagging chick restocking, cold fronts, and avian flu outbreaks.",2023/2/22,3512,Society

However, Abbas said that there was still limited knowledge of Uyghurs outside of Taipei, something she noticed when attending the 2017 Urban Nomad Film Festival in Tainan and Kaohsiung.Speaking to RTI, Abbas said she wants to warn people that if Taiwan does not mobilize the international community to do something to counter China, Taiwan will end up the same as Xinjiang. “(If it is) the Uyghur people today, (it) will be tomorrow for the Taiwanese, and the Japanese and all these Southeast Asian countries, because they are all in danger,” she said.Abbas said she believes that the experience of Hong Kong in recent years is the same as that of the Uyghur people. “Certainly, what happened in Hong Kong is almost an immediate copy of what the police did to Uyghur women, Uyghur protestors, and Uyghur people,” she said.“They even brought the policeman from (Xinjiang),” said Abbas, presumably referring to the Beijing decision to appoint former head of internal security in Xinjiang to lead the People’s Liberation Army’s garrison in Hong Kong.Idris told the audience gathered at parliament that there were several ways Taiwan could help the Uyghur people protect their cultural heritage. He suggested that Taiwan provide vias or scholarships to Uyghurs to allow them to conduct research related to Uighur ethnicity, history, and culture.Speaking at the event, Kaixi responded to suggestions that the people of Xinjiang should compromise with the Chinese government, asking the crowd; if Xinjiang were to compromise, would the Chinese government compromise also?""Looking at the history of the Chinese Communist Party, they will never give in at all,"" Kaixi said.

            Kennedy said Taiwan has become one of Saint Lucia’s biggest benefactors in the last 20 years. Taiwan has been “a trusted and reliable ally,” he said, pointing to joint programs in agriculture, education, health, sports, business and commerce, youth unemployment, and entrepreneurship.

            He quoted Saint Lucian diplomat Nancy Nicholas as saying that “Taiwan's strong and principled diplomacy can always be depended on to help us paddle our ships of state out of the murky waters of complex threats to our socio-economic security.”

            Kennedy said bilateral ties are based on “mutual respect, collaboration, and cooperation.” The two nations are known for their friendly peoples and embrace the rule of law, democratic traditions, individual liberties, and a sense of fairness, he said.











            Taiwan is always eager to share its knowledge and experience with the rest of the world, the ambassador said. “Saint Lucia will continue to clamor and agitate at every international gathering and forum for the inclusion of Taiwan in the decision-making of our planet,” he said.

            Kennedy vowed that his country will continue to respect Taiwan’s right to sovereignty and the right of Taiwanese to choose their leaders and how they are governed.

            He praised Sir George Charles, founder of the Saint Lucia Labour Party and former Chief Minister of Saint Lucia, and Sir John Compton, the first prime minister of Saint Lucia, as “national heroes” who “set the nation on a journey from colonization to independence.”

            Despite the hardships brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, Saint Lucians came out “stronger and more resilient,” Kennedy said. He describes his fellow nationals as “daring people” who “have learned to be determined in our fight for the values we cherish and for the things we hope for.”

            “We are not daunted by any challenge presented to us,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818926,"Taiwan's TSMC Arizona venture: Costs, labor relations worry analysts, employees","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Cost issues, personnel management, and cultural differences have some at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) worried, as their company steams ahead with US$40 billion (NT$1.21 trillion) in investment for its upcoming Arizona chip plants.According to 11 TSMC employees who spoke with the New York Times, the U.S. investment could become a distraction for the company, which has so far relied on a relentless focus on research and development to stay ahead of the market. The New York Times did not name the employees, as they were reportedly not permitted to speak publicly.The TSMC employees are not the only skeptics. “TSMC’s investment in the U.S. from a business perspective makes no sense at all,” said former tech analyst and private equity firm Kirkland Capital Chairman Kirk Yang (楊應超), citing the high cost of the project. Yang believes it is possible TSMC may have embarked on the U.S. based project due to political pressures, but said “so far, the Phoenix project has yielded very little benefit for TSMC or Taiwan.”Constructing the fabs in Arizona is reportedly 10 times more expensive than in Taiwan, a result of unfamiliarity with U.S regulations, and insufficient supply of building materials, The NYT said. High inflation, and competition with Intel, which is also expanding in Arizona, is also reportedly driving up costs.After TSMC founder Morris Chang (張忠謀) told Nancy Pelosi that U.S. plans for the semiconductor manufacturing industry were “incredibly naïve,” Pelosi also reportedly admitted that Taiwanese executives specifically questioned her about whether or not the U.S. environmental and labor laws were sufficient to support such a complicated industry.Labor relations are also at top of mind for the interviewed TSMC employees, who said that they worried the Taiwanese working style might clash with American employees. Eight of the employees interviewed said they believed they would have to pick up the slack for their American counterparts if they were to work alongside them in Arizona.Former TSMC engineer Wayne Chiu, said that he had considered joining the company’s U.S. operations, but abandoned the idea after realizing he would have to make up for his American colleagues’ lack of productivity. Chiu said the biggest issue would not be the technology, but the people.“The most difficult thing is personnel management,” Chiu said. “Americans are the worst at this, because Americans are the most difficult to manage.”",2023/2/23,2130,Business
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818931,US Representative Mike Gallagher urges faster arms delivery to Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — U.S. Representative Mike Gallagher urged Washington to prioritize providing weapons to Taiwan in order to deter Chinese aggression.

            “We need to be moving heaven and earth to arm Taiwan to the teeth to avoid a war,” Gallagher told the Washington Post. “Nobody knows if and when Xi Jinping wakes up and decides to do this but all the more reason to put in place a denial posture as quickly as possible.”

            The representative, who just returned from a secret four-day trip to Taiwan, said that his major takeaway was that “the Taiwanese are doing everything we could ask of them” to bolster their defense capabilities.

            Many of the Taiwanese officials he met viewed the war in Ukraine as a wake-up call, he said, adding that he intends to use his position in the newly established House select committee on China to highlight the importance of heavily arming Taiwan.











            “Our best chance of preventing an invasion of Taiwan, and of essentially preventing World War III, is to put actual hard power on Taiwan … and, to paraphrase President Tsai, to ensure that every day, when she wakes up, we are increasing the cost of an invasion for Xi Jinping,” he said.

            Gallagher pointed out that Taiwan is increasing its defense spending to roughly 2.4% of its GDP, while many NATO countries still fail to commit to the 2% of GDP military spending guideline. Taiwan has purchased multiple weapons platforms from the U.S. in recent years but has yet to receive them due to a backlog in orders from other nations.

            In 2021, Taiwan bought 400 Harpoon missiles and 100 launchers for US$1.6 billion (NT$48.6 billion). However, because Saudi Arabia made a purchase of Harpoon missiles before Taiwan, it is ahead in the delivery queue.

            “Taiwan should be moved to the front of the line for the Harpoons,” Gallagher said. For Saudi Arabia to receive the missiles first “doesn’t make any strategic sense to me,” he said.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — U.S. Representative Mike Gallagher urged Washington to prioritize providing weapons to Taiwan in order to deter Chinese aggression.“We need to be moving heaven and earth to arm Taiwan to the teeth to avoid a war,” Gallagher told the Washington Post. “Nobody knows if and when Xi Jinping wakes up and decides to do this but all the more reason to put in place a denial posture as quickly as possible.”The representative, who just returned from a secret four-day trip to Taiwan, said that his major takeaway was that “the Taiwanese are doing everything we could ask of them” to bolster their defense capabilities.Many of the Taiwanese officials he met viewed the war in Ukraine as a wake-up call, he said, adding that he intends to use his position in the newly established House select committee on China to highlight the importance of heavily arming Taiwan.“Our best chance of preventing an invasion of Taiwan, and of essentially preventing World War III, is to put actual hard power on Taiwan … and, to paraphrase President Tsai, to ensure that every day, when she wakes up, we are increasing the cost of an invasion for Xi Jinping,” he said.Gallagher pointed out that Taiwan is increasing its defense spending to roughly 2.4% of its GDP, while many NATO countries still fail to commit to the 2% of GDP military spending guideline.

In addition, she noted the low wages valid in the hotel sector.Some employers required staff to speak fluent English and Japanese, but they were only willing to pay NT$28,000 a month, Hsu said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4819380,Cut sea cables said to be China's dry run to end Taiwan's internet,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A think tank analyst and columnist for Foreign Policy believes the cutting of two undersea cables tying Taiwan to the outlying Matsu Islands is a dress rehearsal for the complete severing of Taiwan's internet.Chunghwa Telecom's two Taiwan-Matsu submarine cables suffered catastrophic outages on the evening of Feb. 2 and at noon on Feb. 8, drastically affecting customer communication services in the Matsu area. National Communications Commission (NCC) deputy chairman and spokesperson Wong Po-tsung (翁柏宗) said on Feb.17 that according to Chunghwa Telecom, the Taima No. 2 submarine cable was cut by a Chinese fishing boat, and the Taima No. 3 submarine cable was damaged by a Chinese cargo ship.There are suspicions in Taiwan the cables were deliberately cut by the Chinese ships and industry insiders point to two factors that raise concerns. First, it is unprecedented for two submarine cables between Taiwan and Matsu to be cut within just six days.Secondly, the damage occurred close to Matsu. However, telecom executives said that it is difficult to present irrefutable evidence of malicious intent.On Tuesday (Feb. 21), Foreign Police published an analysis of the incidents by Elisabeth Braw, a national security expert at the American Enterprise Institute. She wrote that it is not unusual for undersea cables to suffer damage, ""but losing two in a row is either really unfortunate or quite possibly not a coincidence.""Braw wrote that while the U.S. was paying attention to the sky after the spy balloon incident, China may have been conducting operations at sea. She said Beijing is now watching how the inhabitants of Matsu cope and how they will manage to reconnect with Taiwan proper.She said the location of 380 submarine cables around the world is not a secret, and there are maps detailing their locations to ensure that fishing boat nets do not accidentally damage the cables. The International Cable Protection Committee reports 100 to 200 instances of damaged cables per year.Of these incidents, only 50 to 100 involved fishing boats, while the rest were caused by construction or other activities. Braw reasoned the incidence of damage to the cables linking Matsu was ""disproportionately frequent.""Braw said that so far the cable breaking incidents have mainly involved Chinese sand dredgers and such activity is an example of gray-zone tactics. In addition to requiring the dispatch of Taiwanese patrol ships to drive these dredgers away, it also harms the ecology and seabed, as well as Matsu's operations and communications.She warned that the sabotage of undersea cables could be ""our era's blockade"" and unlike in previous generations, it can be carried out surreptitiously. Braw said other telecoms are looking at Chunghwa's Telecom's backup operations, such as burying them beneath the seabed.She warned that the sabotage of undersea cables could pose a diplomatic challenge for Western governments. ""Responding to a devastating but invisible blockade could become one of the thorniest diplomatic challenges facing Western governments.""",2023/2/23,7250,Politics

The country must adjust its thinking to meet the circumstances and quickly “beef up its preparations for war.”When asked about a potential invasion scenario, Chiu expressed his confidence that China would not be able to conquer Taiwan within a fortnight. “Taiwan can survive, as long as we are supplied,” said Chiu, indicating that allies could be counted on to supply Taiwan during such a conflict.He also warned that if military conflict begins, the entire island of Taiwan would become a warzone: “Once Taiwan is at war, there will be no front and no rear supply, it will all be one war zone ... there are many ways to get to the outside world, and there are also networks and communications that can break the blockade, and there are ways to survive if we can find the gaps.”He added the Chinese Communist Party would not be able to impose a dictatorship on Taiwan. “The people of Taiwan are used to freedom and democracy and cannot accept one-party rule,” said Chiu.The defense minister offered some thoughts on military philosophy in the interview. He said that although avoiding war is always preferable, it remains a soldier’s duty to rise to the occasion when conflict cannot be avoided.

Based on his analysis, China is on the brink of economic collapse because it does not have sufficient population growth to maintain its own economic livelihood.As Zeihan explains, the severity of China’s demographic collapse is the result of Beijing’s one-child policy, which was enacted in 1980 and was in place until 2015. China most likely “passed it’s peak in population 15 years ago, and we are on track for the dissolution of China as an economic entity before the end of the decade,” said Zeihan.With such a large country, both in terms of population and economy, such a catastrophic collapse is unprecedented in human history. The nature and magnitude of this crisis could have unpredictable outcomes politically.However, China is not the only country dealing with serious demographic problems. Among other industrialized nations in Northeast Asia, Zeihan said that South Korea’s situation is the most serious and the most similar to China.Japan, although facing similar problems, has been one of the most proactive countries in the world to prepare for its own population decline. Therefore, Japan is better prepared to weather the economic and social transformation than most countries.As for Taiwan, Zeihan cautioned that it is on a “sharply negative track” in regard to population decline. However, Taiwan also has “a bit more elbow room than either Japan or Korea per capita.” Based on his estimates, Taiwan still has 20 to 30 years before the situation becomes as severe as South Korea.In that time, Taiwan would be wise to follow Japan in adopting measures and policies aimed at mitigating the worst effects of demographic decline.Watch part one of the Taiwan News interview with Peter Zeihan below.

Approximately 39 troops and Department of Defense personnel are reportedly stationed in Taiwan as of September 22, 2022, according to the latest DMDC report.Over the years, the number of U.S. troops in Taiwan has fluctuated, but generally only numbered around a dozen or two. For example, in the last report released during the Obama administration on Dec. 31, 2016, the U.S. had a total troop presence of 10, while under Trump, the number of soldiers from various branches of the military was 20.Raising the number of soldiers to triple digits would represent the largest U.S. troop presence in Taiwan in decades. The troops will reportedly be sent to expand training for Taiwanese soldiers.The newspaper added that the Michigan National Guard is also providing training to a Taiwanese military unit. This will reportedly include the participation of Taiwanese forces in annual war games involving multiple countries at northern Michigan's Camp Grayling.When asked to comment on the increased number of U.S. soldiers in Taiwan, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Thursday referred the media to the Department of Defense.

During the interview, Goldberg asked whether Russia's ""reinvasion"" of Ukraine made it more or less likely that China would take military action against Taiwan in the near future.Blinken said the fact that many countries in Europe and beyond have understood that it ""could open a Pandora's box"" if such military aggression by Russia was permitted without consequences. He said that was why Japan and South Korea have been ""our staunchest partners in this effort from day one.""He asserted that with so many countries teaming up in response to Russia's invasion, it is something ""China factors into its own thinking about Taiwan."" He stressed that the sanctions and export controls imposed on Russia are ""doing serious damage"" and the effects will only continue to accumulate.Blinked suggested that Beijing will have to take the strong possibility of sanctions into account when considering an invasion of Taiwan. He said China will also need to weigh the ""huge reputational costs"" Russia has suffered as a result of the invasion.The secretary of state then emphasized that one important reason why the world is so focused on a potential war in the Taiwan Strait is that it is ""not an internal matter."" Rather, it is a ""matter of concern for quite literally the entire world.""He noted that 50% of commercial container traffic passes through the Taiwan Strait on a daily basis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820395,"Wargame shows Taiwan, US, Japan together could prevent Chinese invasion","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A Japanese think tank simulation found that if the U.S. and Japan became involved in a war between Taiwan and China, Washington and Tokyo could prevent Beijing from invading the country, but at a heavy cost.

Nikkei reported that a tabletop wargame was conducted over four days through Jan. 21 by Japan’s Sasakawa Peace Foundation, involving around 30 participants, including former Japan Self-Defense Force (SDF) officers and Japanese and American academics and researchers. The exercise simulated a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan in 2026.

            The simulation had Taiwanese, American, and Japanese forces facing off against China. In it, the People’s Liberation Army set up a command center capable of deploying all air, submarine, and surface vessel capabilities. The U.S. responded by dispatching nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and advanced fighter jets to locations in and around Taiwan.

            In the wargame, Japan’s prime minister declared a national state of emergency and let America use SDF bases in addition to civilian airports in Okinawa and Kyushu. The exercise then saw Japan call the invasion an “existential threat” after learning Beijing was planning to attack SDF bases used by American forces, Nikkei said.











            Japanese warships and its F-35 fighter jets then take part in missile strikes against Chinese forces. China was eventually beaten by the U.S.-Japan response, with the fighting taking more than two weeks, per the report.

            The simulation found Chinese military supplies getting cut off, and the decisive move came after the allies took control of Taiwan airspace.

            The wargame found that there would be heavy losses for all parties involved. Taiwan experienced 13,000 dead or wounded troops, and lost 200 warplanes and 18 warships, while the U.S. saw 10,700 troop casualties and lost 400 planes and 19 naval vessels.

            Japan saw 2,500 troop casualties and lost 144 fighter jets and 15 warships. Meanwhile, China lost more than 40,000 troops killed or wounded and lost 168 jet fighters, 48 military transport aircraft, and 156 warships, including two aircraft carriers.

            The report noted the Sasakawa simulation was based on the military hardware and capabilities possessed by countries today, and that the actual outcome in 2026 could be different if Beijing significantly increases its military power.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A Japanese think tank simulation found that if the U.S. and Japan became involved in a war between Taiwan and China, Washington and Tokyo could prevent Beijing from invading the country, but at a heavy cost.Nikkei reported that a tabletop wargame was conducted over four days through Jan. 21 by Japan’s Sasakawa Peace Foundation, involving around 30 participants, including former Japan Self-Defense Force (SDF) officers and Japanese and American academics and researchers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4820489,MediaTek to Showcase its Groundbreaking Satellite Connectivity Technology at MWC 2023,"MediaTek is working to bring reliable connectivity everywhere with two-way satellite communications on smartphones and other devices

HSINCHU, Feb. 24, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- At MWC 2023, MediaTek will be demonstrating its innovative 3GPP Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) technology that brings two-way satellite communications to smartphones. The first smartphones with MediaTek's satellite connectivity are also launching, with more devices to be unveiled in the coming months. Additionally, MediaTek will also be sharing a sneak peek of its next-generation 5G New Radio NTN (NR-NTN) technology for the next wave of satellite-enabled devices.

            Satellite networks aim to fill gaps in mobile coverage, offering a reliable way for devices to communicate in remote locations. With satellite-enabled smartphones, consumers can stay in touch when they are hiking, driving in secluded areas, on a boat, or in other situations where there has traditionally been no connectivity; this will not only provide users with peace of mind, but also enable them to request assistance in emergency situations. Today the biggest market opportunity for 3GPP NTN technology is smartphones, although there is a growing demand for satellite connectivity in IoT applications such as agriculture, forestry, and logistics. The automotive industry will also be a major market for satellite communications technology in the coming years.











            ""Two-way satellite communications on smartphones and other devices will usher us into a new era of connectivity and open up new possibilities across many different verticals,"" said JC Hsu, Corporate Vice President and General Manager of MediaTek's wireless communications business unit. ""Our standalone MT6825 chipsets, which are based on the 3GPP NTN open standard, can be integrated into any flagship smartphone to deliver a seamless satellite connectivity experience.""

            Over the coming years, MediaTek's satellite communications portfolio will target both IoT-NTN and NR-NTN technology based on the 3GPP 5G specification for Release 17 (R17). IoT-NTN is ideal for messaging since it is designed for low data rate connections, while NR-NTN allows for higher data rates that can support video calls and other applications. Since satellite networks can currently only support IoT-NTN on a mass scale, the initial wave of satellite-enabled smartphones and other devices powered by MediaTek will be designed for two-way satellite messaging services.

            MediaTek is teaming up with Bullitt to bring the world's first commercially available devices with 3GPP NTN technology, utilizing the MT6825 chipset to connect to the Bullitt Satellite Connect platform. This includes the motorola defy 2 and CAT S75 smartphones; and the motorola defy satellite link, a compact and lightweight Bluetooth accessory that allows Android and iOS devices to connect to the Bullitt Satellite Connect platform. Bullitt Satellite Connect service will provide users with access to two-way satellite messaging, location sharing, and emergency SOS in more places around the world.

            The forthcoming NR-NTN chipset from MediaTek will allow devices to support services with higher data rates like navigation and real-time communication. As satellite networks build capacity for NR-NTN over the coming years, this opens up exciting new consumer, enterprise, and industrial use cases as smartphones, IoT devices, and vehicles can take advantage of reliable connectivity everywhere.

            To make it easy for brands to integrate two-way satellite communications into smartphones and other devices, MediaTek's IoT-NTN solutions are standalone chipsets that can be added to any 4G or 5G device. The chipsets utilize the open 3GPP R17 NTN standard, unlike competing solutions which are based on proprietary solutions. For OEMs, the advantage of the standard is that once a device has been certified for 3GPP R17 IoT-NTN it can be used on any IoT-NTN compliant network. Additionally, mobile network operators can partner with service providers to offer roaming services or establish their own satellite networks that support the standard.

            In addition to the benefits of supporting 3GPP R17 NTN, MediaTek's MT6825 IoT-NTN chipset has a number of other features. MT6825 can connect to Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit (GEO) constellations, which could be converted into 3GPP NTN compliant network easily and are widely available now on the orbit. To provide a seamless experience, MT6825 allows devices to automatically receive messages from satellites, unlike competitive solutions that require users to manually check for messages. The chipset has low system requirements, is very power efficient to provide greater battery life, and comes in a highly integrated design that helps accelerate time to market.

            For years MediaTek has been an active player in driving satellite connectivity innovation forward, serving as one of the main contributors to the 3GPP NTN specifications and working closely with other industry leaders to test and develop 5G NTN solutions.

            MediaTek is exhibiting at MWC in Barcelona, Spain from Feb. 27 through March 2, 2023. Attendees can see MediaTek's satellite connectivity demos by visiting MediaTek's booth in Hall 3, Stand 3D10.

The military said it would continue to observe the object until it left Taiwan’s airspace.It also told civil aviation authorities to warn airplanes about its presence. There was no mention of the balloon's origin.Earlier this month, the Ministry of National Defense dismissed reports that a spy balloon had been seen flying over the Presidential Office Building in Taipei. The object had been located over the ocean 40 kilometers away, the military said.Later, a balloon believed to be used by China to monitor the weather crashed at a military base on the frontline island of Dongyin in Lienchiang County.",2023/2/24,2735,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821175,"Taiwanese determined to fight for country, new research shows","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A clear majority of Taiwanese are prepared to fight for their country in the event of war, new research shows.The findings contradict an oft-repeated narrative peddling the line that Taiwanese are unwilling or unable to defend themselves against attack. The subtext here is that Taiwan intends to rely on the U.S. and its allies to do so instead.This “free ride” claim is not borne out by the data unearthed by Josh Wenger, an American postdoctoral research associate at the Academia Sinica Institute of Sociology, where he is part of a project studying Taiwan's civil-military relations. In fact, Taiwan is, historically, among the most willing of nations to defend itself, according to his as-yet-unpublished paper, Taiwanese Public Opinion on Defense Issues.The “willingness to fight for country” in Taiwan is consistently “above 60% and bipartisan,” among the highest in global polls since the mid-1990s, Wenger tells Taiwan News. His evidence is primarily based on five major surveys from 1995 to the present day.One graph (33) looks at “willingness to protect your country,” and is divided into four time periods. Taiwan is compared to five other “select developed democracies”: South Korea, Japan, Germany, Australia, and the U.S.Taiwan stands at the top of the index in every case, with nearly 80% willing to fight in the latest survey, 2017-2022, while South Korea is second. From 1995-2022, Australia was generally third, followed by the U.S., with Germany and finally Japan least likely to go to war in defense of the motherland.Graph 33. (Josh Wenger, All graphs) 

Graph 34.Graph 36.Graph 35.Related findings are the will to fight was “not affected significantly by the Ukraine War or military exercises after (U.S. House Speaker Nancy) Pelosi visit,” according to Wenger’s research (graph 34). Also, this willingness was not “significantly impacted by how war starts” — meaning respondents were not concerned by whether the cause was a declaration of independence on behalf of Taiwan’s leadership, or was unprovoked and started by China.Here, Wenger also references a Taiwan Foundation of Democracy poll in December 2022 about the will to fight if China makes an unprovoked attack (70%), or Taiwan declares independence (63%).Given the choice, in 2022, a record-high 28% of Taiwan’s population said they would join the Army if there was a need (graph 36). This response followed an “open question” that asked, “What action would you take if there’s a war.”Furthermore, Taiwanese believe their compatriots, or fellow citizens, would also resist China if it attacked (graph 35). Between 2002-2020, the percentage of resistors in the event of a Chinese invasion was considered to be in the range of 52% to 72%, mostly hovering around the mid-60s.These findings contradict naysayers like Daniel Davis, a former U.S. lieutenant colonel and author of “The Eleventh Hour in 2020 America.” He wrote in a 19FortyFive column: “There is no justification for sending American men and women to die on the seas and in the air around Taiwan when the citizens of Taiwan are themselves cool to the idea of dying for their own country.”Such assertions frequently underline the importance of Taiwan adopting a “porcupine strategy” of asymmetric defense, meaning it needs to hold out as long and as strongly as possible before U.S. forces arrive to save the day. It is a position that is also discussed by writers such as the Rand Corporation’s Raymond Kuo, who instead point to the role of Washington and its policy of “strategic ambiguity” as a reason for Taiwan doubting U.S. intentions.Graph 26.Graph 25.Josh Wenger (graph 26) provides evidence for the view that Taiwanese generally doubt the U.S. will become directly involved in a war with China if it invades Taiwan. Most Taiwanese believe the U.S. will only provide weapons, and not send troops – though this latter figure does rise significantly from 19.3% to 33.8% if Taiwan maintains the status quo and does not declare independence.“Taiwanese are definitely skeptical about security guarantees and the confidence of U.S. military intervention,” Wenger comments, pointing to a graph that gives an idea of how the U.S. decision not to support Ukraine with boots on the ground led to significant concern of a similar reaction if there was a Taiwan-China conflict (graph 25). Confidence in U.S. military intervention went down to a historic low of 40% after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and subsequent U.S. inaction.“Those who believe the U.S. will come to Taiwan’s defense will also want stronger self-defense and to invest in their defense,” Wenger observes. “I have found some evidence of a correlation between U.S. support and investing in defense.”This upends the perception that Taiwanese are counting on the U.S. to come to their defense without being prepared to make a similar sacrifice, making it an issue for Washington rather than Taipei.“It poses an interesting argument, which is whether U.S. ambiguity encourages free riding,” Wenger continues. His answer appears to be yes, even as the majority of Taiwanese continue to be willing to fight on, regardless of the U.S. position.The four main findings in Wenger’s illuminating and sometimes surprising paper can be summarized as:Graph 14.Graph 20.Returning to figures like Daniel Davis, who pour scorn on Taiwan’s willingness to fight, confidence in the military, and willingness to invest in defense, the facts largely undermine these views.Confidence in the military declined after 1995 but rebounds during the presidency of Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文). Currently, it stands at 63.2%, higher than Germany or South Korea, but less than Australia and the U.S., with Japan top (graph 14).However, while the willingness to invest in defense has only risen since 2019, after a long-term focus on economic growth in the noughties (graph 20), Wenger describes opinion as “divided,” mostly along party lines.This is not to say that Taiwan is perfectly prepared vis-a-vis potential conflict: “If you look at that question about what would people do if there was a war, that is very troubling to me. In European countries, people would go to the civil defense center. Here, too many people don’t know, or go with the flow.”“Some say they want to fight, but how do you prepare for that moment?” Wenger adds. “I think the government has a responsibility to prepare the population for this, and it's civic groups that are doing this at the moment. I would also advocate improving civil defense preparedness education.”Wenger acknowledges his research findings reflect national political biases. This means DPP supporters are generally more willing to fight, while KMT supporters are more distrusting of the Tsai administration and its institutions, such as the military, and have less confidence in Taiwan’s warfighting capabilities.He then adds the caveat that survey results could be skewed by the way questions were framed, or because of social desirability bias, meaning people may give replies they think society wants to hear, and don’t want to sound cowardly or unpatriotic.“Even so, taking into account 10% social desirability bias still leaves about 60% willing to fight,” Wenger says.",2023/2/25,2293,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821196,Former US national security advisor urges more support for Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. should do more to support Taiwan militarily and politically, former National Security Advisor John Bolton said in an interview with The Washington Post.

            “I think the time for strategic ambiguity over Taiwan has gone,” Bolton said. He suggested the U.S. allow navy ships to port in Taiwan’s Kaohsiung and deploy more troops to train their Taiwanese counterparts.

            Bolton said there is a lot more to be done ""not simply in increasing Taiwan's military capabilities but also showing increased American support.” In the long term, the U.S. should recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation, he said, adding he had made the same proposal in 2000.

            Bolton also recommended the U.S. “integrate” Taiwan into more multilateral defense organizations in the Indo-Pacific region, with Japan, South Korea, Australia and others. “The more Taiwan is linked in with others who worry about China's belligerence, the greater the chance that we can deter any Chinese menace toward Taiwan,” he said.











            The former U.S. official said he believes the recent decision to send 100 to 200 soldiers to Taiwan “was a correct decision.” However, there is a lot more Washington can do, given China’s hostile rhetoric and military buildup, he said.

            Additionally, Bolton said there is public support amongst Americans to defend Taiwan from a Chinese attack.

            “If you explain to the American people the threats we face, the threats our allies face, the threats those represent to the way we live here at home and that steps need to be taken, not out of acts of charity or humanitarianism but for cold, hard American national security interest, I think the American people will respond to it,” he said.
Bolton added that U.S. leaders have not been willing to discuss “the reality and the outside world to the people,” which leads to the public denying the threats exist. He urged politicians “to pick up their socks here and be clearer with the American people.”

            As of Sep. 22, 2022, there were around 39 troops and Department of Defense personnel stationed in Taiwan, according to the latest DMDC report. Over the years, the number of U.S. troops in Taiwan has fluctuated, but usually totals around a dozen or so.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. should do more to support Taiwan militarily and politically, former National Security Advisor John Bolton said in an interview with The Washington Post.“I think the time for strategic ambiguity over Taiwan has gone,” Bolton said.

            In August, South Korea and many other like-minded nations emphasized peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait in response to China’s large-scale live-fire military exercises around Taiwan following former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit, per MOFA.

            At the 17th East Asia Summit in November, U.S. President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, and South Korean President Yoon reiterated that maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait “is an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the international community.”

            Both Taiwan and South Korea are important members of the Indo-Pacific community and they are also threatened by dictatorships with use of force, MOFA said.

            “At a time when authoritarian countries are openly challenging the international order and undermining regional peace and stability, Taiwan is willing to work closely with like-minded countries to jointly defend the rules-based international order, resist the coercion of authoritarian systems, and maintain peace, stability, and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait, the Korean Peninsula, and the Indo-Pacific region,” it added.

            In December, South Korea’s Taiwan-Korean parliamentary friendship group visited Taiwan and met with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文).

The number of bullets and casings found earned the incident the description of the “88 shooting” in Taiwan’s media.Nobody was injured, but the timing just two weeks before nationwide local elections drew public attention and drove up fears of more violence in the run-up to the polls. In the days following the shooting, police arrested five men, but two of the main suspects were thought to have left the country.Hung Cheng-chun (洪政軍), also known by his nickname “Red Turtle,” was considered to be one of the brains behind the shootings, while Kung Hsiang-chih (孔祥志) was suspected of having fired the gun. Both were arrested in the Chinese city of Quanzhou and returned to Taiwan on a flight from Xiamen to Taoyuan International Airport Saturday afternoon, the Liberty Times reported.The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) sent agents to China to pick them up. As soon as they arrived in Taiwan, the two men put on bullet-proof vests, and were taken away by members of the Tainan District Prosecutors Office accompanied by four CIB agents.

This may include potential audits or investigations of telecommunication equipment manufacturers and related businesses, prior to any national mobilization.In addition to tighter control over media and communications, the new draft also calls for stricter penalties for actions detrimental to national security. These include failure to comply with government demands prior to, or during mobilization, disseminating false information, and hoarding critical supplies.Anyone who fails to comply with government directives, or who actively tries to contravene or impede such directives may be jailed for up to seven years, and potentially fined up to NT$7 million (US$230,000).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822705,'Godfather of Taiwan independence' Koo Kwang-ming dies at 96,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Koo Kwang-min (辜寬敏) was born into a powerful business family and worked tirelessly on the cause that would become his life’s passion, Taiwan independence.He passed away at 8:55 a.m. on Monday (Feb. 27), a day before Taiwan commemorates the 228 Massacre, a historical event where Taiwanese rose up and challenged the authoritarian Kuomintang (KMT) regime. Fearing reprisal for his involvement in the protest, Koo would later spend two decades of his life living in exile in Japan.While living abroad, Koo never wavered in his support of self-determination and sovereignty for Taiwan. His views often put him at odds with the government, as he was finally allowed to return to Taiwan in 1975, after receiving assurances from the government that his political actions would not lead to punishment.One of the first politicians to comment on Koo's passing was Taiwan Vice President Lai Ching-te (賴清德), who took to his Facebook page to express his condolences. Lai said Koo was a passionate supporter of Taiwan throughout his life, and also a dedicated humanitarian.Lai noted that Koo had set up an emergency relief account in his hometown of Lukang to promote various social causes and provide assistance to the poor. Koo would also return annually to visit the economically disadvantaged and the infirm, giving them comfort during difficult times.Lai said Koo even donated a parcel of land in Lukang to Taipower last year to support renewable energy. This showed that his love for Taiwan was always rooted in his hometown, though his philanthropic efforts would often lead him much further afield.Praising Koo's dedication to Taiwan, Lai said the former statesman should serve as a model and an inspiration for the younger generation of Taiwanese seeking to enter politics. Concluding his Facebook post, Lai said: ""Please rest in peace, Mr. Koo. Taiwan will be in good hands as we continue to protect Taiwan's democracy, peace, and prosperity.""Koo’s US$1 million (NT$28.5 million) donation to Ukrainian refugees in March 2022 drew praise from the public and local media. In an FTV interview Koo said,“whether it’s a donation of NT$1,000 or my donation of US$1 million to Ukraine, it all comes from the same place in the heart.“Koo went on to explain in the interview: “When Japan entered World War II, I was a student in Taiwan, and I was recruited as a soldier. So, the sadness and cruelty of war is something I have experienced firsthand.”Born in 1926, Koo was the youngest son of Koo Hsien-rong (辜顯榮), a powerful businessman during the Japanese colonial era. His father kept five wives, and his elder half-brother, Koo Chen-fu (辜振甫), would also become an influential politician, though occasionally they would find themselves on different sides of Taiwan’s political divide.As news of Koo's passing was reported in the media today, there was an outpouring of affection for the elderly statesman and pioneer of Taiwan's independence movement, as few will forget his lasting legacy.",2023/2/27,1949,Politics

            Challenge

            Video security surveillance is vital for any and every business' continued well being, whether that organization be small, medium, or large in terms of both number of personnel and size of facility (or facilities).

The owners wanted to check on their location remotely to help them determine if the laundromat needed any attention such as cleaning, snow removal, or general maintenance, while also providing security for both the owner's and customers' property.ChallengeVideo security surveillance is vital for any and every business' continued well being, whether that organization be small, medium, or large in terms of both number of personnel and size of facility (or facilities). Nowadays, NVRs (network video recorders) and even computer hard drives are still popular choices for security professionals, but those that require larger and larger volumes of data as the weeks, months, and years roll by need new ways to effectively store, move, and access these files, many instances when not on site. When stored on site on an NVR or similar hard drive device, precious time is wasted when a security professional is not able to access vital information in real time.VIVOTEK's new cloud-based video surveillance as a service (VSaaS), VORTEX, eliminates these challenges.SolutionCentral Iowa's Tech Zone chose VORTEX and a total of five of its indoor and outdoor security solutions for a comprehensive end-to-end AI surveillance solution that seamlessly integrates deep-learning-based network cameras with cloud video management software to solve The Washing Well's security surveillance solution issues.VORTEX provides intelligent and easy-to-use data analysis services.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4823434,US army secretary says Chinese invasion of Taiwan not imminent,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — China will not likely attack Taiwan any time soon, U.S. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said on Monday (Feb. 27).

            “I’m personally not of the view that an amphibious invasion of Taiwan is imminent, but we have to obviously prepare. We have got to be prepared to fight and win that war,” Wormuth said at an event hosted by Washington, D.C.-based think tank American Enterprise Institute.

            She said that the U.S. wants to “avoid fighting a land war in Asia.” Wormuth added “This is all about deterrence.”

            Meanwhile, U.S. Army Pacific Commander General Charles Flynn said China has hinted that a Taiwan invasion could happen at some point but suggested Beijing probably is not ready to take on such an endeavor.











            “They are on a historical trajectory. The military arm they have created is extraordinary,” he said. “They are preparing those forces for something … The prize is Taiwan.”

            Both officials shared some measures the army is taking to prepare for a regional conflict, including adopting new training and capabilities in the Indo-Pacific, more strategic deployment of troops in the region, and use of long-range hypersonic weapons capable of reaching Mach 5.

            They also stressed the importance of congressional support, especially in terms of funding, and drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine.

            Wormuth and Flynn’s comments follow CIA Director William Burns’ assessment that Chinese leader Xi Jinping may have doubts about his nation’s ability to seize Taiwan by 2027. “I think our judgment at least is that President Xi and his military leadership have doubts today about whether they could accomplish that invasion,” he said in an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday (Feb. 26).

            Additionally, Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) has also warned that ""2027 is a year we need to watch out."" He said China's economy is sputtering and there is growing discontent among the populace.

            If Xi is not able to address these issues during his fourth term in 2027, he may attempt to ""resort to the use of force"" or create an external crisis to distract from domestic issues, Wu said.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — China will not likely attack Taiwan any time soon, U.S. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said on Monday (Feb. 27).“I’m personally not of the view that an amphibious invasion of Taiwan is imminent, but we have to obviously prepare.

I don’t care.“We’re going to stand with freedom and democracy wherever it is in the world, in Ukraine, in Taiwan, and on the streets of Tehran,” said Auchincloss, who is a member of the Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). “We can’t flinch just because the CCP is angry.”",2023/2/28,1793,Politics

Temple authorities contacted local police, who began an investigation to help recover the antique, which had been the centerpiece of the temple.The Weiyang Temple dates back to the Qianlong Period of the Qing Dynasty, a period where arts and craft flourished around 200 years ago. The temple was renovated and expanded in 1923, and underwent many reconstructions to better preserve a number of prized antiques.A researcher of history and literature, surnamed Kuo (郭), a few days ago, discovered a post on social media that resembled the altar owned by the temple. After comparing photos taken by visiting tour groups, he noticed the original altar was still in place in 2019, but it suddenly changed in 2020.Altar recovered after being swapped out by a criminal group. (CNA photo)After further investigation, his suspicions were confirmed. The temple suspected a criminal group may have been working behind the scenes to execute the swap. There was a fear that other Penghu temples might have been similarly duped.After receiving the report, Baisha Police Precinct took up the case and began to identify suspects. Due to the large size of the altar table, and the complexity of producing a replica, police suspected a large criminal group was involved.The police investigation found that the original dragon altar had been moved to Kaohsiung's Cianjin District.

Even better, it could lead to gratitude from European Union (EU) member states seeking to ease the burden of serving migrants and refugees from Ukraine.Lin Chung-cheng (林忠正), a research fellow at the Institute of Economics, Academia Sinica, proposed this creative solution in his commentary to Ettoday. In the article, he says Taiwan could be an attractive destination for Ukrainian workers in terms of Taiwan's wage levels, living costs, affordable healthcare services, order, and public safety.Lin said, given the country's absence of a refugee law, the Taiwan government could relax employment rules for Ukrainians to work in Taiwan's manufacturing, tourism, healthcare, and construction sectors. Furthermore, given the country's low birth rate and shrinking military recruitment pool, the government could consider hiring Ukrainians who have experience on the battlefield and are familiar with Russian and U.S.-made weapons, which can be leveraged in the event of a war with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA).""Their knowledge on the battlefield and of national defense, either in the form of physical or cognitive warfare, would be a great asset to Taiwan's military departments,"" the economist added.The employment opportunities could help the economy of the wartorn eastern European nation if these Ukrainian workers in Taiwan sent money back to their hometown. This could amount to US$900 million (NT$27.6 billion) over three years, as opposed to Taiwanese donating money or material to Ukraine, Lin concluded.",2023/2/28,1417,Politics

            The Tsai administration has reviewed 7,572 files of political parties during the authoritarian period, the president said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4824561,Has this Taiwanese startup cracked realistic plant-based meat?,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Lypid is a San Francisco-based startup founded by two Taiwanese Cornell PhD graduates, and it has one simple goal: “sustainable, tasty, and healthy at the same time.”That is according to the company’s cofounder Jen-yu Huang, who recently spoke to the Startup Island TAIWAN podcast with his cofounder Michelle Cheng. Huang and Cheng’s company is working to create more convincingly “meaty” plant-based meat substitutes by focusing on the fat that goes into them.“There are a lot of alternative proteins on the market right now, but they don’t really taste like real meat,” said Cheng. “Lypid is bridging the gap between the taste of real meats and alternative meats.”Lypid uses a process called microencapsulation to mimic animal fats using plant-based ingredients. The technology alters the structure of the plant-based fats from a liquid to a solid, making it feel more like real meat when eaten. “It’s not just protein, it’s really fat that mimics that juicy mouthfeel,” Huang said.Huang said that there are also many use cases for Lypid’s products that are not exclusively for vegetarian or vegan products. Lypid’s plant fats are what he calls a “complementary” meat product that can be sold alongside traditional meat products, and does not necessarily need to act in direct competition with them.Huang also said that if the plant-based meat industry can leverage the traditional meat industry’s expertise in bringing meat products to market at an industrial scale, plant-based meat products could become widespread much faster. “You can imagine several different approaches, not just vegetarian, or vegan, but …also hybrid approaches,” he said, referencing the possibility of adding his company’s plant-based fats to other meat products to make them healthier.Huang said that the reason why many think plant-based meat substitutes are unhealthy is because of the belief that they are produced with saturated fats. Cheng said that Lypid’s fats are specifically designed to be healthier than traditional saturated fats, and can have 97% less saturated fat than other plant-based options such as coconut oil and palm oil.One of the biggest successes Lypid has had so far is bringing its products to the over 500 Louisa Coffee shops throughout Taiwan. In August 2022, Louisa introduced a line of plant-based burgers.Huang said that Lypid and Louisa went through about six to eight months of development before the product hit the stores. Huang said that for his company, the success of their products at Louisa stores shows that the coffee chain and its consumers have faith in their products, and want to see more of them.",2023/3/1,1484,Business

The report said that the stadium's waterlogging problems were the result of contractors failing to meet construction standards previously agreed to by both parties.A NT$40.9 million (US$1.34 million) drainage budget was reportedly covertly removed from the plans, but the officials in charge of overseeing the budget ignored this. The report named more than 10 officials suspected of having acted in neglect of their duties, the highest level official being the current Deputy Minister of the Interior Wu Tang-an (吳堂安).In addition to the substandard drainage work, it was also discovered that the main contractor for the project, Chuchia Construction, failed to adhere to the soil thickness requirements stipulated in the contract tendered by Hsinchu City Government in 2018. Within the past few days, the Hsinchu City Government excavated the stadium’s soil and discovered the major deficiency.According to Mirror Media, the city government will not rule out further excavation to determine whether contractors had breached the Waste Disposal Act, or whether civil servants had committed fraud. The Hsinchu District Prosecutors Office is carrying out a separate independent investigation and will determine whether either the construction supervisor AECOM or the construction company Chuchia Construction has civil liability for the failures.To make matters worse, the report detailed an apparent ongoing pattern of industrial safety failures by Chuchia Construction. The government officials responsible for the company's safety record reportedly neglected to do so, allowing the company to win the contract despite its poor record.The Wei Chuan Dragons, the team for whom the stadium was constructed, have not yet been able to use the stadium, and are expected to bring legal action against the Hsinchu City Government over the incident, according to Mirror Media. A letter was sent from the team’s management to the city government in August last year requesting compensation for the ongoing delays to the stadium’s completion, and a suspension of the lease, but an agreement has not been reached.Hsinchu City Government Spokesperson Shih Shu-ting (施淑婷) said that the request for suspension of the lease does not amount to a termination of the lease.

Enabling efficient power supply design

            Data centers, telecom equipment and many industrial applications are increasingly requiring larger power supplies, while also requiring reduced system size, weight, environmental impact and cost. This has challenged engineers to find new ways to reach higher power levels, in the same or smaller form factors, while also enhancing thermal performance. To address these power density challenges and requirements for future power supplies, LITEON leveraged TI GaN and C2000 real-time MCUs to achieve a flexible daughter-card design. The design also helps engineers shorten project design cycles by allowing them to scale the design to different power supply requirements.

            LITEON design engineers collaborated with TI experts to accelerate the adoption of GaN technology in their PSU design, working together to optimize the power loop and daughter card layout. Additionally, LITEON leveraged TI's expertise in power FET and controller design to improve the reliability of the PSU through comprehensive system-level verification. The flexible high-resolution pulse-width-modulation (PWM) actuation from TI's C2000 real-time MCUs and GaN also helps engineers enable high switching frequency, advanced topologies, and switching schemes.

An army led by such personnel could not possibly be able to fend off Chinese invaders, it said, citing unspecified military sources.According to the Nikkei report, a retiree from the Army said there are still “many spies out there in Taiwan’s military” assisting China. This is the reason the U.S. has been circumspect in its arms sales and aid to Taiwan for fear that intelligence might be leaked to Beijing.Asked to comment on such allegations at a legislative interpellation, Feng, who previously served as Taiwan’s defense minister, appeared irate, rebutting them as “nonsense,” according to CNA.However, Beijing has been recruiting Taiwanese military personnel. Only last week, a former Taiwan Army colonel who had signed statements that guaranteed his surrender to China in a potential cross-strait conflict was sentenced to seven years and six months in jail on corruption charges.Taiwan’s defense ministry on Wednesday (March 1) rejected relevant claims as “fabricated” and hurting the morale of the country’s armed forces.

That represents a 61.42% increase over the 70 reported by the Ministry of National Defense (MND) in February 2022 and a 182.5% increase from the 40 recorded in February 2021.On Wednesday (March 1), open-source intelligence expert Damien Symon uploaded a map to his Twitter account showing the location of all 113 intrusions by PLAAF aircraft into Taiwan's ADIZ. The majority of encroachments occurred in the southwest corner of the zone.There was also a cluster of flights that took place off the northwest coast of Taiwan that crossed the median line. There were a few longer-range flights that covered large swathes of the southeast corner of the ADIZ.The only sector that did not report trespassing by PLAAF aircraft was the eastern portion of the ADIZ. The northeast corner of Taiwan's ADIZ directly borders Japan's southwest ADIZ, which has also been the scene of a large number of incursions by Chinese military aircraft.For his January map, Symon included flights by Chinese military aircraft through the Miyako Strait in Japan's southwest ADIZ. The strait runs between Miyako Island and Okinawa.Chinese military aircraft violations of both Taiwan and Japan ADIZs.

Although Taiwan just had a long weekend for the 228 Memorial Day holiday, Wang said that there does not appear to be an upswing in new cases.Wang said that the outbreak continues to show a flat trend and the number of moderate and severe COVID cases and deaths has decreased in comparison with previous weeks. Therefore, Wang said that the next stages of easing epidemic prevention can be discussed.Wang said the preliminary plan is to loosen regulations in three stages. In the first stage, there will be a loosening of rules in the community with priority given to the completion of a new system exempting mild COVID cases from reporting and quarantine.The second stage will be to loosen requirements in medical institutions, research the establishment of special wards, and revise nosocomial infection control operations. The third stage will be to downgrade the classification of COVID from a Category 5 communicable disease to a Category 4.Wang said that only when COVID is reclassified as a Category 4 communicable disease will the CECC be downsized or disbanded.He pointed out that in April, the World Health Organization will discuss whether to end COVID's designation as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Then, in May, Wang said that the U.S. and Japan would begin to downgrade their classification of the disease.With the loosening of the indoor mask mandate on school campuses on March 6, Wang noted that preparations for the additional easing of regulations will begin next week.

However, after the vessel was searched by divers, no one was found inside and the lifeboats were missing.Because it appears its Taiwanese captain and 15 Indonesian crewmembers may have taken the lifeboat, there is a possibility that they are alive at sea. Currently, Taiwan's Fisheries Agency is asking Mauritian authorities and nearby ships to continue to assist in the search and rescue efforts.The 98-ton ship departed from Port Louis in Mauritius on Oct. 7, 2022 and was last reported to be operating about 490 nautical miles to the northeast of the port before radio contact was lost on Feb. 19. The Fisheries Agency received a report that it was missing on Feb. 23 and immediately requested ships in the area to assist with the search.On Feb. 25, the agency received a report from a Taiwanese fishing boat that it had found what it suspected to be the overturned hull of the Lien Sheng Fa. Mauritian authorities then dispatched a team of divers to inspect the wreckage and confirmed that it was the Lien Sheng Fa.Liberty Times cited a source in the fishing industry as saying that lifeboats are standard equipment and are generally equipped with simple rations and drinking water. The source said that most modern lifeboats are tied to a fixed point on the ship and must be manually untied by crew members to be deployed.Such lifeboats are now generally designed to automatically inflate when they hit the water, said the source. For these reasons, there is a possibility that the crew survived the capsizing of the ship and were able to board the lifeboats.The fishing boat was found 150 nautical miles from the last location it had broadcast from.

He said Chiang should take responsibility and dismantle the Taoyuan mausoleum where Chiang-Kai Shek’s coffin is currently preserved and bury his coffin, per CNA.Chen said that according to Taiwan law, apart from during ceremonies conducted on the day of a funeral, corpses are not allowed to remain in coffins unburied. According to the Mortuary Service Administration Act, Chen’s assertion is correct, though this may conflict with Taiwan’s National Burial Act, which allows for a memorial hall to be established for citizens of the “Republic of China with special service or an outstanding contribution to the improvement of the status of the nation.”Whether or not Chiang Kai-shek’s contribution to the nation was outstanding remains controversial, as Taiwanese still live with the memory of his authoritarian military dictatorship.

Physicians at the hospital said that although the mother and son had no obvious trauma to the head, they had suffered multiple abrasions and bruises on the torso.According to physicians, the abdomen, liver, spleen, and other organs of the victims suffered massive hemorrhaging, causing acute shock and impaired brainstem function. Meanwhile, Azeez had his left wrist bruised.At the scene of the accident, Chen told Azeez and police officers that he did not see the family when he began to make his turn onto Yicai Road due to dim lighting.

Sullivan said the information provided in his speech was based on a question he had posed to intelligence agencies, other think tanks, and combatant commands: ""What would the world look like in the aftermath of a successful invasion of Taiwan by the CCP?""Sullivan said Taiwan produces 92% of the world's most advanced semiconductors. ""Imagine what would happen if that was not only taken offline but controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)?""He said the Commerce Department estimated the U.S. economy suffered US$240 billion in damage from low-end chip supply shortages caused by the pandemic.Based on a U.S. State Department report, Sullivan said the global economy would suffer NT$2.5 trillion dollars in losses per year if Taiwan was invaded by China. He said it would also impact U.S. advanced weapons systems such as F-35 fighter jets, radars, and missile defense capabilities.Citing former President Dwight D. Eisenhower's memoirs, he said the loss of Taiwan would compromise the security of Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Okinawa. Sullivan said the fall of Taiwan would be an event that ""breaks China out of the constraints of the first island chain.""He warned that a China no longer constrained by the first island chain would then threaten the second island chain, which includes the U.S. territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.

Six Indonesian migrant workers also involved in the operation received two-year prison sentences and deportation orders upon their release.Taoyuan prosecutors seized the marijuana from a field next to an army base in Longtan District in September 2022. They confiscated 4,218 marijuana plants in total with a market value of more than NT$1.26 billion (about US$40 million).The trial revealed the two Taiwanese involved in the operation had legal jobs, but began to grow the marijuana to earn extra money. They obtained the marijuana seeds from a third party, now deceased, and employed six migrant workers to provide manual labor.The trial revealed that some of the migrant workers believed they were engaging in legal gardening work. After discovering there were marijuana plants, they were not able to easily find other employment that would continue to allow them to support their families back home.The plant had not been harvested at the time of seizure, so there were no proceeds to be confiscated. One of the Taiwanese sentenced was on a monthly salary and earned nearly NT$500,000 in total, which will be confiscated according to the law.Of the migrant workers, three were employed for less than a month and likewise received no income. The other three received salaries but were providing for their low-income families in Indonesia, and may not have been aware the crop was marijuana, so the full amount of their salaries would not be confiscated, according to the verdict.Cannabis is illegal in Taiwan, and the manufacturing, transporting, or selling it is punishable by up to lifetime imprisonment by law. Under Taiwan law, it is in the same class as fentanyl and methamphetamine.In 2022, Taiwan reduced the penalty for growing marijuana for personal use from five years to one year, and lowered the fine from NT$5 million to NT$1 million.Despite this, a lack of social awareness of marijuana and its use in Taiwan means it remains highly taboo, a Taiwanese lawyer, Zoe Lee (李菁琪), told the Hong Kong free press in 2021. “All education basically teach(es) us that weed is a kind of drug and it will poison you and if you start (using) weed right now, the next day, you’ll start using heroin, and you’ll start to rob people, you’ll start killing for money, then you’ll have more money to buy more drugs,” she said.",2023/3/3,2561,Society

Hsu, a member of the KMT, was elected as a legislator in a 2015 by-election, and vacated the seat to take her new position as county executive.The two primary candidates vying for office in Saturday’s election are Tsai Pei-hui (蔡培慧), representing the DPP, and Lin Ming-chen (林明溱), who hopes to hold on to the seat for the KMT.Lin was the previous executive of Nantou County, having served from 2014 to 2022 until Hsu’s election to the office. Lin also has experience as the legislator for Nantou’s second district. He was elected in 2008 when the constituency was formed and served until he was elected county executive in 2014.Tsai also has experience as a member of the Legislative Yuan, having served from 2016 to 2020. As a legislator who was nominated by the DPP based on proportional representation, she did not represent a specific district. However, Tsai previously campaigned in Nantou's first district for a legislative seat in 2016. In that election, she lost to the KMT’s Ma Wen-chun (馬文君) who has held the seat since 2009.On Thursday (March 2), Lin received an endorsement from Foxconn founder Terry Gou (郭台銘). Touting Gou's endorsement and his previous experience in office representing Nantou, Lin has expressed confidence that he will be re-elected to his former office.President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and other notable DPP politicians made their way to Nantou on Friday (Mar. 3) to drum up support for Tsai Pei-hui on the eve of the election.Since the two current legislative constituencies in Nantou were established in 2008, the county has never been represented in the Legislative Yuan by members of the DPP. In previous legislative elections, the KMT has taken about 55% of the vote share on average in both of Nantou’s two districts, with the DPP taking between 40% and 46%.While the DPP hopes that Tsai can gain the confidence and support of people in Nantou in this year’s by-election, the KMT is eager to hold onto the legislative seat in what it considers a reliably blue county.Despite the KMT’s confidence after their strong showing in last year’s municipal elections, Saturday’s by-election will not change the DPP’s majority in the Legislative Yuan.",2023/3/3,555,Politics

Shawn Wen (溫宗憲), the Taiwanese co-founder and CEO of a London-based AI company PolyAI, believes that with ChatGPT, generative AI has reached a similar milestone.Speaking on the Startup Island TAIWAN podcast, Wen said that ChatGPT represents a marketing breakthrough more than it does a technological one. “(This helps to) bring people’s attention, bring in more resources, and help the business to grow, so in that way ChatGPT is important,” he said.Kyle Pi (皮克宇), also Taiwanese, and the co-founder and CEO of InstAI agreed, saying that initially he wasn’t impressed by ChatGPT as it did not represent any kind of technological breakthrough. “Architecture and process-wise, there’s not much innovation, so early on I was actually very against it,” he said.“I thought this is just another large language learning model, people spending a lot of money, and then training a toy (to) claim that it can have human emotions,” Pi said. However, he said that once he put on his “business hat,” he realized where the value in the product was.He said he is excited to see what new applications will be found as it continues to learn from human input. “So, with my business hat on, I think it’s really exciting, but with my tech hat, I know what it is, and it’s not rocket science,” Pi saidWen’s company creates realistic voice assistants currently used in the U.K., and said that he would not yet use ChatGPT to generate sentences for customers as it is still too unreliable, though it can be used for other applications. He said that ChaptGPT can summarize the content of the 700 to 1,000 calls his company receives every second, and generate daily reports that help improve the efficacy of the voice assistant in the future.Wen said that while big companies like Google are beginning to look at it, these companies need highly accurate outputs for their services, something that ChatGPT can not yet provide. “(This kind of) information needs to be close to 100% accurate,” he said.“ChatGPT doesn’t guarantee that, in fact, all the generative AI doesn’t guarantee that.”",2023/3/7,550,Business

The two main candidates are the Kuomintang’s (KMT) Lin Ming-chen (林明溱) and the Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) Tsai Pei-hui (蔡培慧), who have accused each other of trying to interfere with the election results.Lin said that hidden cameras had been reported outside polling venues, and also made accusations that DPP electoral inspectors were filming voters with their phones. In Taiwan it is illegal to film, broadcast, interfere, or “use mobile phones” to influence voters.Tsai, meanwhile, said that protestors had intimidated her supporters, gathering outside polling stations and chanting “do you want war?” She also said that voters were being recorded.According to CNA, the covert cameras were removed from the election site at Nantou Ying Pan Elementary School polling station, after the public alerted them to them. Four people were subsequently taken by police for questioning.Ordinarily, the Nantou second electoral district would be relatively unimportant on a national scale. However, the election is the first in Taiwan since Lai Ching-te (賴淸德) became the chairman of the DPP, and will be the last held before the 2024 presidential election.Given the DPP’s disastrous results in the 2022 local elections, the Nantou by-election is seen by some as a possible indication of the DPP’s chances of remaining in power in 2024.",2023/3/4,1314,Politics

Saturday’s result marked the first victory for the DPP since Vice President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) took over as party chairman in January, following the ruling party’s poor performance in the regional polls.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827360,War in Ukraine diminished China's hope of easy victory in Taiwan: Peter Zeihan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Geopolitical analyst and consultant Peter Zeihan discussed the economic, demographic, and political landscape in East Asia with Taiwan News in early February.In part one of the interview, Zeihan explained China’s ongoing demographic crisis. In part two, he shares his perspective on the potential for military conflict between Taiwan and China. In his view, the likelihood of a serious military engagement between Taipei and Beijing is relatively low.

However, this somewhat optimistic view is tempered with the caveat that, in the midst of China’s catastrophic population decline and Xi Jinping’s (習近平) increasing isolation at the reins of power in Beijing, political outcomes may be unpredictable. In Zeihan’s estimation, the current military conflict in Ukraine has heavily influenced Beijing’s calculus toward its plans for a military operation to capture Taiwan.In his interview with Taiwan News, Zeihan outlines four key assumptions that the leadership in Beijing likely held prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, over the past year of conflict, all four of those assumptions have been almost entirely undermined.The first assumption is that Beijing could win the war quickly and easily. In light of the prolonged conflict that Russia has committed itself to in Ukraine, in addition to the geographic advantage that Taiwan has over Ukraine in an invasion scenario, this assumption is “out the window,” says Zeihan.The second assumption relates to the effectiveness and reliability of Russian weaponry and logistics equipment, which China has heavily invested in. Zeihan suggests that the performance of Russian weapons and hardware in Ukraine may be causing China some “serious buyer’s remorse.”The third assumption relates to the possibility of international sanctions that other nations would likely use to target China. Given Russia’s experience, China must understand the risks that sanctions would present.“If you take the sanctions that are on Russia and put them on Beijing, you get a deindustrialization collapse, complete with a famine in less than six months,” he said.Similarly, the fourth assumption, which Zeihan thinks ""really terrifies the Politburo,” is the idea that Beijing could evade international boycotts if it were to attack Taiwan. Beyond government sanctions, Zeihan believes the prospect of global companies abandoning investments and walking away from the Chinese economy may serve as a strong incentive for Beijing to avoid military action.At the end of part two, Zeihan discusses how a war would affect Taiwan’s advanced semiconductor industry, and how Washington might respond.Zeihan offers a warning to Taiwan that its days as the primary manufacturer of the highest-end chips are not going to last much longer. He says this period is headed toward its end “regardless of what happens with the United States or war with China.”Part two of Peter Zeihan’s interview with Taiwan News can be viewed below.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827660,Taiwan's eased school mask mandate Q&A,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan on Monday (March 6) lifted its indoor mask mandate for schools at all levels, but there are three settings in which masks will still be required and schools have the option to modify rules as needed.After imposing mask requirements for over 800 days, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) largely ended the mask measures for schools at all levels, kindergartens, after-school institutions, and cram schools. Generally, faculty, staff, and students can decide whether or not they want to wear masks in the classrooms, but there are some exceptions. The following is a Q&A on the new policy posted by SET News.Masks are now optional in campus classrooms, but they are still required in school health centers and when taking school buses and shuttle buses, according to the CECC.Ministry of Education (MOE) Chief Secretary Liao Hsin-kuo (廖興國) said that when there is a possible need for masks in special fields or lectures, the school may decide whether to implement a mask requirement. However, school administrators must first explain this rule change to teachers and students and not implement it unilaterally through administrative procedures to avoid dissatisfaction among teachers and students.CECC head Victor Wang (王必勝) pointed out that the MOE's principle for loosening the mask mandate is ""independent mask-wearing,"" respecting the freedom of students and teachers to decide when they will wear masks. In addition, Wang said that subjects that would require the wearing of masks would be set by the organizer or responsible department.He said that there is no penalty for ""independent mask-wearing,"" and stressed that people should mutually respect each other's choices when it comes to wearing or not wearing a mask.Under this program, classmates of students who test positive for COVID can continue to attend in-person classes as long as they are asymptomatic and receive a negative result from a rapid antigen test.Liao said that the relevant departments will be invited to simplify the content of this program in the near future. Liao said it is possible that the airport model will be followed in which rapid antigen tests will only be distributed to those who request them, but he said the implementation period must still be discussed with relevant units before it is announced.Philip Lo (羅一鈞), deputy head of the CECC's medical response division, said after campus mask rules are relaxed, the center will pay attention to the situation with infections in schools and monitor children aged 6 to 12 and 12 to 17 to determine whether there is a sudden spike in cases. However, Lo said that the preliminary assessment by the CECC is that the loosening of mask rules will not impact the overall trend of the COVID outbreak in Taiwan.",2023/3/6,2343,Society

He appealed to the central government for help, per UDN.Chen said the county government previously subsidized the delivery of food and materials to Juguang, though these funds have been cut. He called for reinstatement of such aid to assist cargo ships delivering food and materials to the area.Army Command Headquarter said on Sunday night (March 5) that a cargo ship leased to Matsu’s Juguang military base has completed repairs in the past two days. It added that a meat shortage does indeed exist at a Juguang market, with troops having no choice but to eat canned food for two days.A soldier stationed in Matsu posted in a Whistleblower’s Commune Facebook group that said the cargo ship had not been operational for a month, claiming some soldiers felt deprived of food and felt a sense of abandonment by the Ministry of National Defense (MND).KMT Legislator Chen Hsueh-sheng (陳雪生) said the MND should have taken measures to ensure Matsu's food supplies. Chen pledged to ask Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-chen (邱國正) such questions during an appearance before the Legislature’s Foreign and Defense Committee on Monday (March 6).",2023/3/6,2415,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827880,51% of Americans back strong stance against China to prevent Taiwan invasion,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A new poll has found that more than half of Americans think that standing up to China to prevent an invasion of Taiwan is more important than maintaining close ties with Beijing.As cross-strait tensions continue to escalate, a survey of 1,500 American adults conducted by the Economist and the polling company YouGov from Feb. 25-28 found that 51% of respondents feel it is more important the U.S. government ""take a strong stand so that China does not take over Taiwan by force,"" while only 24% believe maintaining good relations with China is a higher priority. In the event of a Chinese invasion, 37% of respondents support the U.S. sending troops to defend Taiwan.Among those who claimed to closely follow Taiwan Strait issues, 70% believe the U.S. should take a tough stance against China to prevent it from invading. In contrast, only 18% of respondents who keep abreast of the region believe that maintaining good relations with China is more important, while 12% were not sure.Unlike other divisive issues, when it comes to Taiwan, views were similar among Democrats, Republicans, and independents. When asked whether the U.S. should take a strong stand against China, Republicans led the way with 58%, followed by Democrats with 55%, and independents with 41%.On whether the U.S. should mobilize military power to protect Taiwan in the event of a conflict, 37% said they supported it, 22% said they did not support it, and the other 41% felt that they did not know enough about the issue to provide an opinion. However, among those who claim to monitor cross-strait developments, 63% believe that the U.S. should send troops, 25% do not support it, and 12% did not feel they know enough about the topic.Again, Republicans, Democrats, and independents shared similar views.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4827883,Analysis: Foxconn races to become an EV player and the clock is ticking,"TAIPEI/DETROIT, March 6 (Reuters) - Foxconn wants to do for electric vehicles (EVs) what it has done with the iPhone, but first, it needs to find the next Apple – and fast.
The Taiwanese contract manufacturer faces competition in the market for creating white-label EVs that can be tailor-made for clients, whether that's a major automaker or a delivery provider or any other company.
And while the electronics giant brings established strengths to the mostly loss-making EV industry, Foxconn needs to win a big contract to prove it can ride the wave of disruption, analysts say.
Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW), will provide an update on its EV manufacturing business when it reports results on March 15.
""The results of many of our collaborations will be realized one after the other in 2023,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters. ""The demand for EVs is driving industry disruption where prominent traditional automakers have and are pivoting to finding solutions for mobility that are cleaner and smarter.""
The company's proposition is simple: let us build your next EV. It is developing a specialized supply chain, including chips and batteries, and has acquired the former General Motor Co (GM.N) plant in Lordstown, Ohio. It has also hired a former Nissan (7201.T) executive, Jun Seki, to lead its efforts.
For now, by building in Ohio, Foxconn can offer customers access to U.S. federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, Daiwa Capital Markets analyst Kylie Huang said. That's a selling point as traditional automakers juggle building gasoline-powered vehicles with plans to build their own EV capacity.
""If they don't get one this year, next year will be more difficult,"" Huang said of Foxconn's search for an EV contract with a traditional automaker.
Failure to ""catch this wave"" could force Foxconn to vie with lower-tier Chinese automakers who might switch to EV contract manufacturing and compete on cost, Huang said.
Canada's Magna International (MG.TO), a top auto supplier, already builds cars for others, and China's Geely (0175.HK) has expressed interest. China's Guangxi Automobile Group has started to make EVs on contract for Japanese delivery company, Sagawa Express Co.
Foxconn is counting on its Mobility in Harmony EV platform, or MIH, to win customers. It calls MIH ""the Android system"" for EVs and is soliciting partners in an effort to standardize technologies so model variants can be developed quickly and cheaply.
""We want to create that kind of ecosystem so anyone - for example, like United Airlines – can say, 'I want to make a car,'"" Foxconn chief product officer Jerry Hsiao told Reuters during a tour of the company's sprawling Ohio plant.
""Sooner or later, maybe the top, traditional (automakers) say, 'Hey, I want to become a product marketing company. Why do I need to carry so many employees?'"" he said.
Hsiao also worked on the first Android phone for Google and now sees EVs at a similar commercial inflection point.
Foxconn's ambitions are aggressive. Initially targeting 5% of the global EV market and the equivalent of $33 billion in revenue from manufacturing EVs and components by 2025, Foxconn's longer-term goal is to make nearly half the world's EVs.
EV sales have been rising, led by China. Five percent of the market, assuming an EV adoption rate of about 20% by 2025, would be around 900,000 vehicles, roughly what market-leader Tesla (TSLA.O) sold in 2021.
'NOT MAKING IPHONES'
""In the EV market, everyone's eyes are bigger than their stomach,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions.
His firm estimates Foxconn hitting about 65,000 vehicles in 2025 and 157,000 in 2026. ""They're not making iPhones here,"" he said.
EV outsourcing will reach $36 billion in 2025 and $144 billion in 2030, with 800,000 and 3.2 million EVs, respectively, Goldman Sachs estimates.
Key for Foxconn will be scoring the first big customer to anchor its Ohio plant, which currently builds a small number of electric Endurance pickup trucks for Lordstown Motors, in which it owns a stake. It has announced plans to build a vehicle for EV startup Fisker (FSR.N).
Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way told reporters last month he plans to visit U.S. customers, Foxconn's Ohio plant and Mexico, where Foxconn has made significant investments in auto parts, in March or April.
""There should be some related signing activities,"" Liu said.
Foxconn already supplies parts to Tesla and makes camera modules for automakers and suppliers.
""They can probably buy things cheaper than anyone on earth,"" Raymond Tsang, a Shanghai-based partner at consultancy Bain & Company, said of Foxconn.
The race for volume in an industry where Tesla and other EV makers are cutting prices raises the stakes.
The former GM plant in Ohio that Foxconn purchased from Lordstown Motors is one of the highest volume single-line vehicle assembly plants in the world. It could build about 320,000 vehicles a year, excluding overtime.
Foxconn wants to build around 300,000 EVs at the plant, Ian Upton, director of production control at Foxconn Ohio, told Reuters.

Over the past year, Delta Thailand shares have increased in value by a whopping 163%, exceeding 1000 Thai baht (NT$890) for the first time on Thursday (March 2.)The growth follows the Thai government’s February announcement that it will work towards transforming the country’s highly developed automotive supply chain away from combustion engines and towards EVs. At the same time, the Thai government also announced a range of economic incentives for EV producers and consumers, including reducing import taxes by 40%, and subsidizing EV purchases by 70,000 to 150,000 baht per vehicle.In January Bloomberg reported that despite the record growth, analysts were predicting an over 41% drop in value over the coming year. The company’s share price was down 2.4% at market close on Monday (March 6), but has generally continued to climb since the analysts’ comments.The Taiwanese parent company Delta Electronics Inc. is also riding high on the EV boom and in February recorded a profit for the first time since it entered the EV business in 2008, per Business Next.

He said the troops being stationed there was pointless.He added that everyone knows Kinmen people get their daily necessities and food from the Chinese city of Xiamen, which is just 5 kilometers away at the nearest point.“I advocate a complete withdrawal of troops to remove the most likely thing to cause a conflict on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and offer China the most meaningful olive branch in the past 70 years,” Shih posted on Facebook.He added that turning what was now the “small war zone” of Matsu and Kinmen into a zone of peace would ensure mutual respect, equality, and peaceful coexistence.Shih blasted politicians and generals who he said support the militarization of the islands ""out of self-interest,"" rather than being rational.""It is making the remote islands vulnerable to enemy invasion and the ill-motivated politicians or generals would profit if there was a conflict between the U.S. and China,"" he said.He noted that even though the number of troops on Kinmen and Matsu has been massively reduced over the years, two large defense commands for the islands still exist.Soldiers made headlines on Monday after they wrote messages in the sand of a Matsu beach complaining about the lack of fresh food.In February, a bipartisan group of Kinmen legislators submitted a petition to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) also calling for the island’s permanent demilitarization. They cited concern over mounting tensions between China, Taiwan, and the U.S.The legislators said they did not want history to repeat itself, referencing the heavy shelling endured over the course of two Taiwan Strait crises throughout the 1950s.Shih said that he had discussed the issue with legislators last month, and that he hopes to report to President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文）what was discussed.“I saw that members of the Kinmen Council, regardless of party affiliation, have put forward a call for a ‘Kinmen Permanent Demilitarized Zone,’ hoping to get rid of the threat of war, engage in regional exchanges, and improve their living standards,” he said.Shih is a major figure in Taiwan’s current and historical political landscape. He was an early champion of the Tangwai movement, which was the first in Taiwan to challenge the Kuomintang’s military dictatorship.Shih spent a total of 25 years in prison as a political prisoner between 1962 and 1990, and was elected to the legislature for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan’s first-ever free elections in 1992.

Ahead of the meeting, Chinese nationalist blogger Zhou Xiaoping (周小平), who has been included as a member this year, posted several of his proposals on his Weibo account.On Friday (March 3), Zhou uploaded a post in which he called on the Chinese government to generate a disciplinary order containing a ""blacklist of separatist figures in Taiwan."" Zhou wrote that people on this list will be ""ordered to stop all Taiwan independence activities"" within a set time frame and ""confess their crimes through open channels or voluntarily surrender.""Zhou warned that when China launches its ""special operation,"" borrowing Russian President Vladimir Putin's term for his invasion of Ukraine, ""anyone can arrest or kill"" people who ""persist in creating divisions and triggering cross-strait conflicts."" He added that any Chinese who launch these reprisals against Taiwanese will not only do so free from culpability but will also ""receive the Medal of Honor for promoting unification.""On Saturday, Zhou claimed that his proposed resolution had already been approved by the CPPCC.Australia-based Chinese political observer and former Chinese diplomat Han Yang (杨涵) on Monday (March 6) posted his English translation of Zhou's proposal on Twitter. Zhou said the fact that his Weibo post has remained untouched for days indicates that the ""Central Propaganda Department approved this vicious message.""Zhou Xiaoping, controversial wolf warrior author, sponsored a resolution at CPPCC for China to set up a black list of “Taiwan separatists” to be killed during China’s Special Military Operation against Taiwan pic.twitter.com/tREbWAh6Bl",2023/3/7,7400,Politics

Other expenses Chen claimed included a hotpot meal, groceries from Carrefour, items from a Linkou outlet store, and the cost of a Mother’s Day meal.Prosecutors have also indicted Chen for colluding with Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) Legislator Tsai Pi-ru (蔡壁如), who reportedly told Chen about possible labor regulation infringements at Mirror TV, after which Chen launched an investigation into the company. Following the investigation, Chen provided Tsai with confidential information that Tsai then passed to TPP Legislator Lai Hsiang Ling (賴香伶), who used the findings to publicly question the station’s political neutrality in March 2022.The leaked information was used by TPP legislators to hold a press conference in which they questioned Mirror Media’s ties to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and made allegations of possible government interference in the media.

The remaining ship is apparently too large to dock at the smaller wharf on the island of Juguang, leading to the long delay.Lii said he supported the decision to send a transport plane to supply Matsu's soldiers, but that the county government also owed a duty of care to the residents of Matsu. He said it was unfortunate that the county government had yet to come forward with a clear plan for solving the problem.The manager of Juguang guesthouse Together Station told Taiwan News the island is about to enter the tourist season, and that she is worried the transportation situation hasn’t been improved, noting the cost of shipping had doubled recently. She said she had heard there would be an additional cargo ship this week, but Taiwan News cannot confirm this.The manager said finding a way to import ingredients or find another supplier from the larger township of Nangan is her biggest challenge. She said that while the two cargo ships are out of action, the remaining one does not operate on a fixed schedule, making it hard to order products from Taiwan when they are needed.The manager also said that ordinarily, for the one-hour journey between Juguang and the larger port at Nangan, ships are not refrigerated. She said that it would be possible to use privately run refrigerated shipping options, but that the cost of this would be “unimaginable.”There is one 7-Eleven in Juguang, but the guest house operator said that supplies there are limited. “Instant noodles and biscuits are finally on the shelves today,” she said.Matsu’s lack of meat made headlines on Monday after soldiers complained that they were only getting canned meat, in “S.O.S” style messages written in the sand on the island’s beaches.

(TWSE: 2495), the industry-leading enterprise storage provider, today releases an updated High Availability (HA) service to complement their EonStor GS unified storage solutions. The updated HA service supports both block- and file-level storage to fortify continuous operation capabilities, making it ideal for enterprise critical data storage systems.

            EonStor GS is a unified storage system with dual redundant controllers designed for enterprises to counter against a single point of failure. Utilizing HA service with two EonStor GS storage systems at separate locations, written data are synchronized onto both storage systems. In an event where one of the systems ceases to provide service due to unforeseen circumstances, the other storage system will take over immediately, with the transfer transparent to users. This ensures continuous service and zero data loss.

            The block-level HA service on EonStor GS brings great benefits to database and virtualization applications. Especially for industries such as medical, finance, telecommunication, public sector, advanced manufacturing technology can all take advantage of the active-active infrastructure to guarantee service continuity. It helps to avoid reputation damages and revenue losses caused by temporary cease of services.











            The newly added file-level HA service also provides continuous service and zero data loss. It aims to accommodate modern corporate file-sharing for team collaboration with multiple user access. When a file becomes inaccessible, work will stop and it negatively affects the overall productivity. The file-level HA service can minimize the above said risks by ensuring data availability.

            ""Infortrend is dedicated to provide enterprises with reliable storage solutions. The newly updated HA service can dramatically maximize data availability to achieve near-zero recovery time objective (RTO) and zero recovery point objective (RPO),"" said Frank Lee, Senior Director of Product Planning at Infortrend.

Bloomberg on Wednesday (March 8) cited McCarthy as confirming he indeed plans to meet with Tsai during her visit to his home state of California.McCarthy emphasized that his meeting with Tsai, ""has nothing to do with my travel, if I would go to Taiwan.""

He then reiterated that vow in February after taking Pelosi's post and had been reportedly preparing to take a bipartisan group of lawmakers with him.However, the Financial Times on Tuesday cited a Taiwanese official as saying that Tsai had presented McCarthy with, ""some intelligence about what the Chinese Communist Party is recently up to and the kinds of threats they pose.""

Potential candidates at this point are Vice President and DPP Chairman Lai Ching-te (賴清德), New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜) of the KMT, and former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) of the TPP, while Foxconn founder and billionare Terry Gou (郭台銘), who is looking to return to the KMT, has also said he is interested in running.Wang served as the head of the Control Yuan under the Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) administration between 2008 and 2014 and as finance minister between 1990 and 1992. The 84-year-old Wang is known for his tax expertise and wide range of philanthropic activities.In 1993, he left the KMT after a feud with other party factions and co-founded the pro-China New Party with other former prominent KMT members. The New Party advocates peaceful unification with China and is opposed to Taiwan's independence, while it has failed to secure any legislative seats since 2016 and has become increasingly marginalized.Wang told the media that Taiwan should have diverse political views. He said he feels that the DPP's pro-independence views and the KMT's ambiguity between pro-unification and pro-independence will lead to Taiwan's doom if China decides to invade.""Taiwan is now in an extremely dangerous situation, and I will join the race for the good of the people,"" Wang said in an interview with Awakening News. He claimed the DPP was too friendly to the U.S. and obsessed with power at the expense of the people.""The NT$500 billion in arms deals with the U.S. should all be scrapped,"" Wang said. The pro-China candidate claimed that the weapons were unnecessary due to his belief that ""Chinese won't attack Chinese.""Despite his opposition to U.S. arms sales, he emphasized that he is not anti-American and is grateful for the decade-long financial aid the U.S. provided to Taiwan between 1951 and 1965.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829470,Taiwan's gross national income tops South Korea for 1st time in 20 years,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan's gross national income (GNI) per capita last year beat South Korea's for the first time in 20 years, due to greater relative depreciation of the South Korean won to the U.S. dollar and stronger performance by Taiwan's semiconductor industry.South Korea's GNI per capita last year was US$32,661, representing a 7.7% decrease from 2021, according to the Bank of Korea. In 2022, the won suffered a 12.9% depreciation against the dollar, leading to a drop of 8.1% in South Korea's nominal gross domestic product (GDP) denominated in U.S. dollars.However, the bank pointed out that on a won basis, South Korea's nominal GDP actually rose 3.8% over the previous year to 2,150.6 trillion won. In addition, its GNI on a won basis rose by 4.3% to 42.203 million won.With a GNI per capita of US$33,565 in 2022, Taiwan exceeded South Korea's GNI by US$904. This marks the first time Taiwan has surpassed South Korea's per capita GNI since 2002.Meanwhile, the New Taiwan dollar depreciated less against the U.S. dollar compared to the won at 6.8%.Darson Chiu (邱達生), a research fellow at Taiwan Institute of Economic Research's (TIER) Department of International Affairs, outlined two main factors cited by CNA leading to Taiwan rising past South Korea. First, the won depreciated against the U.S. dollar more than the NT dollar.The second factor, according to Chiu, is that during the pandemic, Taiwan's exports, particularly of semiconductors, increased amid the accelerated adoption of the digital economy. Meanwhile, South Korea's trade surplus turned into a trade deficit, dragging down its economic performance.Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) Vice President Wang Jiann-chyuan (王健全) told CNA that Taiwan's economic growth rate has been strong over the past years. Wang said that the pandemic has driven telemedicine, online entertainment, and consumer electronics, while the U.S.-China technology war has driven semiconductor orders from Taiwan.Wang said Taiwan is also leveraging its geographical location with its New Southbound Policy. He asserted that Taiwan's epidemic prevention measures have been effective while not negatively impacting Taiwan's manufacturers.As to why South Korea's exports and economic performance have not been commensurate, Wang said that South Korea's semiconductor production is mainly designed for consumer electronics, while Taiwan's chips have a more diversified customer base. For example, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has a dominant market share of high-end semiconductors, while the demand for consumer electronics has declined, impacting South Korea more severely.Wang said in recent years, South Korean firms have also faced increasing competition from Chinese rivals. In addition to semiconductors, South Korean companies face fierce competition from Chinese corporations in other industries such as consumer electronics, home appliances, and mobile phones, greatly hampering exports.",2023/3/8,4514,Business

Inbound migrant workers will also have more options in terms of self-health monitoring locations and the room regulations for that period will also be eased.In order to utilize Taiwan's ""one-stop service,"" new migrant domestic caregivers should still log into the MOL's Entry And Departure Of The Foreign Labor Airport Care Service website and provide relevant information five days before entry. New industrial migrant workers (including institutional caregivers) must log into the website to arrange to be picked up at the airport three days before entry. Returning migrant workers should also log into the site before arrival.The WDA said starting on March 15, arriving migrant workers can undergo the required seven days of self-health monitoring in places such as their employer's house, worker dormitories, or hotels. There should only be one person per room that ideally has a separate bathroom.However, the WDA explained that if the bathroom and toilet can be adequately cleaned and disinfected after each use, incoming migrant workers can stay in a private room that shares a bathroom with others.In addition, self-health monitoring sites are no longer required to be registered with the central government, nor do they need to be approved by country and city governments.In response to concerns about transportation to self-health monitoring facilities, the WDA said it will loosen the regulations on transporting industrial migrant workers (including institutional caregivers) and migrant workers returning to Taiwan. Beginning March 15, employers, brokers, and other designated personnel will be allowed to pick up migrant workers from the airport and take them to their self-health monitoring accommodations. In addition, newly recruited domestic caregivers will be picked up by designated vehicles and taken to the Migrant Worker One-Stop Service Center.Further details on eased COVID restrictions that go into effect March 15.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4829713,Google ups journalism funding in Taiwan with NT$300 million in grants,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Google will provide NT$300 million (US$9.8 million) in funding for journalistic projects in Taiwan over the next three years, but Taiwan's media industry has still not come to an agreement with big tech companies as it seeks payment for use of its content.Google launched the Taiwan News Digital Co-Prosperity Fund on Wednesday (March 8) to provide grants for Taiwan news media organizations and journalists in a move the company said will support the “transformation, development, and sustainability of the news industry."" Applications for funding will open in May.Despite the grants, the issue of tech giants' unpaid use of news content on their platforms still looms large. Taiwan's media industry has joined other countries in calling on the big tech companies to pay for the use of its content, but interested parties have still not reached an agreement.In December 2022, Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) and media industry representatives launched the first round of discussions with Google and Meta. Deputy Digital Minister Lee Huai-jen (李懷仁) said the next round of discussions is likely to happen in March.News Partner Manager of Google Taiwan Adrian Gregory Lui (陳漢隆) said that Google was focused on ""common prosperity"" instead of ""profit sharing."" He said that Google only displays snippets of news content in its search results, such as titles, pictures, and abstracts.Lui also said this helps Taiwanese news outlets by directing traffic to their websites, which Google does not profit from. Despite this, many in the media industry believe that Google's massive ad revenue is built on the backs of news content it does not pay for, though this is not universally agreed upon.Government interventions requiring big tech companies to pay news outlets for content have yielded mixed results. Google pulled its news services from Spain in 2014 after the country passed legislation requiring it to pay news outlets for content. It relaunched in Spain eight years later, after the country adopted EU regulations that allowed it to publish very short extracts of news.In 2021, Facebook also briefly removed news content from Australian users' feeds after Australia passed a law requiring tech companies to pay local operators for content. Services were restored only a few days later, but as a result of the law, Australia's national broadcaster said it was able to hire 60 more regional journalists, expand existing bureaus, and open new ones.Companies like Google and Facebook certainly have changed the way news media is consumed. Market research commissioned by Google indicates that 81% of people now obtain their news through the internet or social media, and between 2003 and 2020, ad revenues for ""traditional publications"" dropped by 70%.",2023/3/8,1441,Politics

The National Communications Commission, citing the island’s telecom service, blamed two Chinese ships for cutting the cables. It said a Chinese fishing vessel is suspected of severing the first cable some 50 kilometers (31 miles) out at sea. Six days later, on Feb. 8, a Chinese cargo ship cut the second, NCC said.Taiwan’s government stopped short of calling it a deliberate act on the part of Beijing, and there was no direct evidence to show the Chinese ships were responsible.The islanders in the meantime were forced to hook up to a limited internet via microwave radio transmission, a more mature technology, as backup. It means one could wait hours to send a text. Calls would drop, and videos were unwatchable.“A lot of tourists would cancel their booking because there’s no internet. Nowadays, the internet plays a very large role in people’s lives,” said Chen, who lives in Beigan, one of Matsu’s main residential islands.Apart from disrupting lives, the loss of the internet cables, seemingly innocuous, has huge implications for national security.As the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has shown, Russia has made taking out internet infrastructure one of the key parts of its strategy. Some experts suspect China may have cut the cables deliberately as part of its harassment of the self-ruled island it considers part of its territory, to be reunited by force if necessary.Couple takes photos near antiquated 240mm howitzer at observation deck at base turned into amuseum on Nangan Island. (AP photo)China regularly sends warplanes and navy ships toward Taiwan as part of tactics to intimidate the island’s democratic government. Concerns about China’s invasion, and Taiwan’s preparedness to withstand it, have increased since the war in Ukraine.The cables had been cut a total of 27 times in the past five years, but it was unclear which country the vessels hailed from, based on data from Chunghwa Telecom.Taiwan’s coast guard gave chase to the fishing vessel that cut the first cable on Feb. 2, but it went back to Chinese waters, according to an official who was briefed on the incident and was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Authorities found two Chinese ships in the area where the cables were cut, based on automated identification system data, similar to GPS, which shows a vessel’s location.“We can’t rule out that China destroyed these on purpose,” said Su Tzu-yun, a defense expert at the government think tank, Institute for National Defense and Security Research, citing a research that only China and Russia had the technical capabilities to do this. “Taiwan needs to invest more resources in repairing and protecting the cables.”Internet cables, which can be anywhere between 20 millimeters to 30 millimeters (0.79 inches to 1.18 inches) wide, are encased in steel armor in shallow waters where they’re more likely to run into ships. Despite the protection, cables can get cut quite easily by ships and their anchors, or fishing boats using steel nets.Even so, “this level of breakage is highly unusual for a cable, even in the shallow waters of the Taiwan Strait,” said Geoff Huston, chief scientist at Asia Pacific Network Information Centre, a non-profit that manages and distributes Internet resources like IP addresses for the region.Without a stable internet, coffee shop owner Chiu Sih-chi said seeing the doctor for his toddler son’s cold became a hassle because first they had to visit the hospital to just get an appointment.A breakfast shop owner said she lost thousands of dollars in the past few weeks because she usually takes online orders. Customers would come to her stall expecting the food to be ready when she hadn’t even seen their messages.Faced with unusual difficulties, Matsu residents came up with all sorts of ways to organize their lives.One couple planned to deal with the coming peak season by having one person stay in Taiwan to access their reservation system and passing the information on to the other via text messages. Wife Lin Hsian-wen extended her vacation in Taiwan during the off-season when she heard the internet back home wasn’t working and is returning to Matsu later in the week.Some enterprising residents went across to the other shore to buy SIM cards from Chinese telecoms, though those only work well in the spots closer to the Chinese coast, which is only 10 kilometers (6.21 miles) away at its closest point.Others, like the bed and breakfast owner Tsao Li-yu, would go to Chunghwa Telecom’s office to use a Wi-Fi hot spot the company had set up for locals to use in the meantime.“I was going to work at (Chunghwa Telecom),” Tsao joked.Chunghwa had set up microwave transmission as backup for the residents. Broadcast from Yangmingshan, a mountain just outside of Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, the relay beams the signals some 200 kilometers (124 miles) across to Matsu. Since Sunday, speeds were noticeably faster, residents said.Telecom equipment seen on top of hill in Beigan, Matsu Islands on Sunday, March 5, 2023. (AP photo)Wang Chung Ming, the head of Lienchiang County, as the Matsu islands are officially called, said he and the legislator from Matsu went to Taipei shortly after the internet broke down to ask for help, and was told they would get priority in any future internet backup plans.Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs publicly asked for bids from low-Earth orbit satellite operators to provide the internet in a backup plan, after seeing Russia’s cyberattacks in the invasion of Ukraine, the head of the ministry, Audrey Tang, told The Washington Post last fall. Yet, the plan remains stalled as a law in Taiwan requires the providers to be at least 51% owned by a domestic shareholder.A spokesperson for the Digital Ministry directed questions about the progress of backup plans to the National Communications Commission. NCC said it will install a surveillance system for the undersea cables, while relying on microwave transmission as a backup option.Many Pacific island nations, before they started using internet cables, depended on satellites — and some still do — as backup, said Jonathan Brewer, a telecommunications consultant from New Zealand who works across Asia and the Pacific.There’s also the question of cost. Repairing the cables is expensive, with an early estimate of $30 million New Taiwan Dollars ($1 million) for the work of the ships alone.“The Chinese boats that damaged the cables should be held accountable and pay compensation for the highly expensive repairs,” said Wen Lii, the head of the Matsu chapter of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.Wang, the head of Lienchiang County, said he had mentioned the cables on a recent visit to China, where he had met an executive from China Mobile. They offered to send technicians to help. But compensation, he said, will require providing hard proof on who did it.China’s Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a faxed request for comment.For now, the only thing residents can do is wait. The earliest cable-laying ships can come is April 20, because there are a limited number of vessels that can do the job.A month without functional internet has its upsides too. Chen Yu-lin, the bed and breakfast owner, has felt more at peace.It was hard in the first week, but Chen quickly got used to it. “From a life perspective, I think it’s much more comfortable because you get fewer calls,” he said, adding he was spending more time with his son, who usually is playing games online.At a web cafe where off-duty soldiers were playing offline games, the effect was the same.“Our relationships have become a bit closer,” said one soldier who only gave his first name, Samuel. “Because normally when there’s internet, everyone keeps to themselves, and now we’re more connected.”",2023/3/9,3167,Politics

            Of the 11 People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, five entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), according to the MND.

            No PLA aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait median line during this time. In response, Taiwan sent aircraft, naval ships, and used land-based missiles to monitor the PLA aircraft and vessels.

            So far this month, Beijing has sent 133 military aircraft and 33 naval vessels around Taiwan. Since September 2020, China has increased its use of gray zone tactics by routinely sending aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ.











            Gray zone tactics are defined as “an effort or series of efforts beyond steady-state deterrence and assurance that attempts to achieve one’s security objectives without resort to direct and sizable use of force.”

            The charity event, held in partnership with SKAL International Taipei Club, was originally planned to be a cultural one, but after the earthquake occurred, it shifted its focus to affected Syrians. “The goal of the event was to spread awareness of the Syrian victims of the earthquake and to show Taiwan’s support and solidarity not only to Syria but all the countries that were affected by this earthquake,” according to the chamber of commerce.

            When the earthquake happened, the press only spoke about Turkey, chamber of commerce chairman Wael Hamouie said. “Nothing has been mentioned about Syria.”

            Hamouie said Syria is still suffering from a nine-year civil war and is now dealing with two challenges since the earthquake struck. Because of the war, Syria has no friends to help, he said. He lamented that the international community mostly provided aid to Turkey, while Syria barely received any assistance.











            The chairman said he wanted to raise money at the event to provide food and supplies for 700 families in Aleppo in a matter of two weeks. The boxes of supplies will have the name “Taiwan” clearly displayed, he added.

            “I want to let the people of Syria know that this is from the Taiwanese.”

            Hamouie mentioned that his office is currently working with multiple NGOs including the Red Crescent.

            Those who want to help can contact the Arab Chamber of Commerce for more information.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4830188,China can use TikTok to drive Taiwan narrative in US before attack: FBI,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — When expressing concerns about the threat to national security, FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday (March 8) said the Chinese government can control the data of millions of users in the U.S. through TikTok and use this to influence public discourse, including discussions about Taiwan.The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee held a hearing on global security threats on Wednesday. When Marco Rubio, committee vice chairman, asked the director whether the Chinese government through TikTok's parent company ByteDance can ""control data on millions of users,"" Wray replied ""Yes.""Rubio then asked if Beijing can utilize TikTok to ""control software on millions of devices,"" to which Wray also replied ""Yes."" The senator then asked whether China might leverage TikTok to ""drive narratives"" to divide the American public.Rubio asked if it is plausible that during preparations to invade Taiwan, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could use TikTok to ""make sure Americans are seeing videos arguing why Taiwan belongs to China"" and why the U.S. should not intervene. Wray again replied affirmatively and warned that there may not be many outward signs if such a propaganda campaign was launched.Wray stressed that what the American people need to understand is that while in the U.S., the distinction between the private sector and the public sector is sacrosanct, ""that's a line that is nonexistent in the way the CCP operates.""Responding to a request from Senator Michael Bennet to describe the dangers of TikTok to Americans, Wray said most Americans would object to handing their private data to the CCP if they were aware of this risk. Wray said the CCP can use TikTok user information to conduct big data operations that involve activities such as espionage and IP theft.Wray said that ""data is the coin of the realm"" and that ""those who have the best information have the power."" The FBI director then said that TikTok provides the CCP with three major digital weapons to conduct hostile actions against the U.S., including data, their recommendation algorithm, and software.He then explained that TikTok hands Beijing ""the control of the data, to conduct all sorts of big data operations, it's the control of the recommendation algorithm, which allows them to conduct influence operations, it's the control of the software, which allows them to then have access to millions of devices."" Combining those three elements together with the fact that it is a tool controlled by the CCP, ""and to me, it screams out with national security concerns.""A dozen U.S. senators introduced a bipartisan bill on Tuesday (March 7) titled the RESTRICT Act that would allow the government to issue bans on foreign-based technologies that pose a threat to U.S. national security, such as TikTok. Mark Warner, the bill's sponsor and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that this legislation enables the U.S. Department of Commerce to impose a number of restrictions, including prohibitions on foreign technology platforms such as TikTok that are used by foreign adversaries to pose an ""undue or unacceptable risk to national security.""White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan also issued a special press release on Tuesday praising the bipartisan bill. Sullivan said in the statement that the bipartisan bill ""would empower the United States government to prevent certain foreign governments from exploiting technology services operating in the United States in a way that poses risks to Americans’ sensitive data and our national security.""Today, #FBI Director Christopher Wray joined the directors of other U.S. intelligence agencies to testify on global security threats before the Senate Intelligence Committee. pic.twitter.com/qmWgqeAKwQDuring the discussion on the Chinese government during today's Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, when asked about TikTok, #FBI Director Wray said that platforms within the control of the Chinese government pose a serious threat to American national security. pic.twitter.com/kKETsNe7Qw",2023/3/9,1626,Politics

A French investigation pointed to the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) overseas police stations as the culprit and that the institute has since improved its cybersecurity.The attack appeared to be part of the CCP’s drive to push political narratives in its favor and interfere with activities among local Taiwanese communities, she said. Similar incidents have also been reported in Australia, Canada, and Latin America, CNA quoted her as saying.L’Encrier Chinois, the attacked institute, had not experienced cyber threats in its 17 years of history until after it joined the network of the Taiwan Center for Mandarin Learning (TCML) in late 2021, said Lin Shu-ling (林淑琳), head of the school, in November. Attacks hit when new information was published on the school’s website and social media.TCML is an initiative that promotes Mandarin acquisition with Taiwanese characteristics and is touted as a “free and democratic alternative” for learners.

China Airlines employees played a key role in the “division of labor” required to carry out the scheme.The scandal came to light in 2018, when allegations surfaced that two National Security Bureau (NSB) officers conspired to use presidential flights to avoid paying taxes on up to 10,000 cartons of cigarettes. China Airlines eventually admitted that between 2014 and 2019, an estimated 35,000 cartons of cigarettes were pre-ordered on presidential flights, going back three presidential administrations.NSB officials were found to be pre-ordering the cigarettes ahead of a presidential trip and storing them in airport tax-free warehouses. When they returned, they loaded NT$6 million worth of cigarettes in government vehicles and joined the president’s motorcade to avoid detection.The NSB officers and the smuggled cigarettes were intercepted by customs officers, who were apparently tipped off prior to the flight’s arrival. NSB officers Wu Tsung-hsien (吳宗憲) and Chang Heng-chia (張恒嘉) were sentenced to over 10 years in prison in 2021.Seven other NSB officials and four China Airlines employees also received prison sentences of between six months to two years. The sentencing court’s verdict said that at least 73 people were believed to have ordered cigarettes illegally smuggled under the cover of presidential trips, but none were prosecuted.In 2019 President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) apologized for her government’s lack of oversight in the scandal, though she is apparently not a smoker herself.",2023/3/9,1135,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831047,China’s Xi calls for ‘more quickly elevating’ armed forces,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s leader Xi Jinping has called for “more quickly elevating the armed forces to world-class standards,” in a speech just days after a top diplomat warned of the growing possibility of conflict with the U.S. unless Washington changes course.China must maximize its “national strategic capabilities” in a bid to “systematically upgrade the country’s overall strength to cope with strategic risks, safeguard strategic interests and realize strategic objectives,” Xi said Wednesday.His remarks to delegates in the ceremonial parliament representing the People’s Liberation Army, the military wing of the ruling Communist Party, and the paramilitary People’s Armed Police, were carried by the official Xinhua News Agency.Xi issued a series of calls to accelerate the build-up of self-reliance in science and technology, bolster strategic capabilities in emergency fields, make industrial and supply chains more resilient and make national reserves “more capable of safeguarding national security.”The program laid out by Xi dovetails with a number of national strategies already underway, including the “Made in China 2025” campaign to make China dominant in 10 key fields from integrated circuits to aerospace, and a decades-old campaign for civilian-military integration in the economy.Xi also mentioned the need for “achieving the goals for the centenary of the PLA in 2027,” a date by which, according to some U.S. observers, China intends to have the capability of conquering self-governing Taiwan, an American ally, by military means.China has defined the centenary goals in mostly vague terms, such as greater “informatization” and raising the PLA to “world-class standards.”China needs to build “a strong system of strategic deterrent forces, raise the presence of combat forces in new domains and of new qualities, and deeply promote combat-oriented military training,” according to a speech Xi gave last year.On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Qin Gang had warned in unusually stark terms about the possibility of U.S.-China frictions leading to something more dire.“If the United States does not hit the brake, but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing and there surely will be conflict and confrontation,” Qin said in his first news conference since taking up his post last year.“Such competition is a reckless gamble, with the stakes being the fundamental interests of the two peoples and even the future of humanity,” he added.That echoed remarks made by Xi on Monday to delegates that seemed to underscore Chinese frustration with U.S. restrictions on access to technology and its support for Taiwan and regional military blocs in unusually blunt terms.“Western countries led by the United States have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression of China, which has brought unprecedented grave challenges to our nation’s development,” Xi was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua News Agency.A State Department spokesperson, Ned Price, responded by saying Washington wants to “coexist responsibly” within the global trade and political system and has no intention of suppressing China.“This is not about containing China. This is not about suppressing China. This is not about holding China back,” Price said in Washington. “We want to have that constructive competition that is fair” and “doesn’t veer into that conflict.”Meanwhile on Wednesday, Gen. Laura J. Richardson, Commander of the U.S. Southern Command, which is responsible for South America and the Caribbean, testified before the House Armed Services Committee that China and Russia were “malign actors” that are “aggressively exerting influence over our democratic neighbors.”China is “spreading its malign influence, wielding its economic might, and conducting gray zone activities to expand its military and political access and influence,” Richardson said.“This is a strategic risk that we can’t accept or ignore,” she added.Among other activities, China has built a massive embassy in the Bahamas, just 80 kilometers (50 miles) off the coast of Florida.“Presence and proximity absolutely matter, and a stable and secure Western Hemisphere is critical to homeland defense,” Richardson said.On Thursday, Beijing’s Foreign Ministry dismissed U.S. questions and criticisms of Chinese intentions as an attempt to “make excuses for its military expansion and pursuit of hegemony.”“Before criticizing and blaming other countries, the U.S., as the only military superpower armed to the teeth, should reflect on what it can and should do,” spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing.In a nod to a China-U.S. relationship that has sunk to its lowest level in decades, she said Washington “should meet China halfway and push China-U.S. relations back on the track of sound and stable development, which is beneficial to both countries and the world.”",2023/3/10,2142,Politics

Additionally, it will assert its claims in the East China Sea, which is contested by Japan.“Beijing is working to meet its goal of fielding a military by 2027 designed to deter U.S. intervention in a future cross-Strait crisis,” ODNI said. The Chinese navy and air force seek to gain air superiority and project power beyond the first island chain, the office said.China recently announced it will increase its military spending by 7.2% to approximately 1.55 trillion yuan (US$224 billion).“The armed forces should intensify military training and preparedness across the board, develop new military strategic guidance, devote greater energy to training under combat conditions and make well-coordinated efforts to strengthen military work in all directions and domains,” outgoing Premier Li Keqiang (李克强) said at the opening of the National People’s Congress on March 4.",2023/3/10,615,Politics

            Held on Thursday (March 9) at AWS offices in Taipei, the event featured women in a variety of careers, from tech accelerators, business development specialists, and social media experts. Panel discussions gave many the chance to air their frustration with gender inequality and the glass-ceiling in many corporations.

            SoGal Foundation is dedicated to closing the diversity gap in entrepreneurship and venture capital. The foundation hosts initiatives to ensure inclusive access to education, networks, and investment capital.

            “Right now, the ratio of female founders in the start-up community is only 20%, whereas males account for 80%. I want to change this status quo,” said AppWorks Principal Alyssa Chen (陳敬旻). She expressed disdain for the word “empowerment” as it applies to women in the work force, as she always believed that she had power equal to her male peers.











            Chen said it was not easy breaking into the tech accelerator industry despite the steep learning curve, though she still enjoys her work six to seven years into her profession. “I think there are a lot of stereotypes that we have to break. We have to make steps to not only be gender neutral, but also be careful about the patterns and biases we put on other people.“

            For example, Chen said that when we mention a soccer player, we automatically think of a male person, and when we encounter the term ballerina, we think of a female. “We need to check ourselves first, and see how much bias we have, and then influence our circle, and grow the circles bigger and bigger.""

            While Chen feels the need to change stereotypes in the office place, the same was not the case for founder and chair of Anemone Ventures, Revital Shpangental.

            “I simply experience challenges as a business person. I don’t have a lens for gender. My challenges are building a business from scratch and building something. Being a woman is an advantage, as men feel that we are less competition and they even want to share information with us. This is power, a way for us to maneuver and progress,” said Shpangental.

            For Chang Yuan-yuan (張圓圓), founder of the Dadaocheng art gallery, No Copies, “failure is the first step toward success.” She treasures each of the difficulties that she has endured from her transition from being the lead of a prominent accounting firm to someone now opening her fifth gallery.

            When she was with Ernst and Young, she worked with an Indian team and they earned 20% more for their work because they negotiated every item in the contract and fought for their best interest. At first, she thought they were being selfish, but it was really about business culture. She said she appreciated that learning experience.

            For other panelists like Fluv CEO Candace Chen (陳思璇), becoming an entrepreneur was something that she learned from her mother. “I was raised by a single mother who was a software engineer. Having her as a role model inspired me as she helped me become who I am today.”

            “To overcome your obstacles, you have to find your 'why.' It can help you get through anything. I wanted to start a pet care company even though I have no technical background. This did not stop me from achieving my dream. I interviewed 300 engineers to find three people that were interested and eventually one became our CTO,”” said Chen.

            For Tuteemi CEO Camila Saenz, becoming a businesswoman simply was not part of her life plan. “I love triathlons and was happy as a photographer for seven years and I did work with other NGOs. I simply saw a problem and wanted to find a solution.”

            This inspired her to start an online tutoring company. She says that as a Latina she had a different perspective when it came to language learning. And as for her business acumen, some of it stems from her family, which is involved in the coffee business.

            “When it comes to obstacles, as women are always going to have obstacles and we will need to find solutions,” said Saenz.

            Kassy Cho, founder and CEO of Almost says, “I decided to start my company after graduation when I worked for Buzzfeed in London. It was exciting to me that young women were making positive changes. I saw that there was nothing serving the next generation of young women to get the info that they need.""

            “As a woman of color in London, sometimes we can experience conscious and unconscious discrimination. It can be difficult to break in if you are not a white guy who went to Cambridge or Oxford. Finding allies is hard and when we find them we can lean on them to help you.""

However, the Council of Agriculture (COA) on Thursday (March 9) announced that the price of duck eggs would also increase on Friday.The COA said the farm gate price for duck eggs on Thursday was NT$45 per Taiwan catty (600 grams), while the wholesale price ranged between NT$55-NT$60. However, it said both wholesale and farm gate prices would rise by NT$3 on Friday, with the latter climbing to NT$48, a record high.Chiang Wen-chuan (江文全), deputy head of the COA's Department of Animal Industry, said duck eggs are mainly consumed as processed salted egg yolks. Chiang said that there are two holidays when they are consumed the most: Lunar New Year and Dragon Boat Festival.As the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, duck eggs are one of the popular fillings for some zongzi, and stocking up will begin at this stage, resulting in an increase in demand. In addition, due to the recent shortage of chicken eggs, some eateries have switched to duck eggs instead.Chiang said the high price of feed combined with these changes in supply and demand has led to a price increase of NT$3. When asked whether the culling of ducks at farms impacted by bird flu would lessen the supply of ducks this year, Chiang said there are still more than two million ducks at this stage and the supply will not be affected.Kao Chuan-mo (高傳謨), chairman of an egg sales association, told UDN that due to the shortage of chicken eggs, many consumers have switched to buying duck eggs, thus leading to a shortage of the latter as well. Kao said that as the price of duck eggs increases, the price of processed century eggs and salted duck eggs will increase accordingly.Kao said egg farmers, egg merchants, and consumers are all affected. The pandemic combined with the avian flu epidemic has cost Taiwan's egg processing factories more than NT$20 million over the past three years, while one has closed down recently, said Kao.As for when the egg shortage will dissipate, Kao said if the weather improves, supplies will not be as tight as they are now, but to restore normal production levels, more chickens will need to be acquired.",2023/3/10,1569,Society

She said that the U.S. treasury, commerce groups, the intelligence community, and others have been working to estimate the impact an invasion would have on the availability of Taiwan’s semiconductors.Director of the CIA William Burns echoed Haines, saying that his agency does not see any evidence that Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平) has made a decision to invade Taiwan, and that China’s ambitions, while not to be underestimated, have likely been tempered by observing the outcomes of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He said Xi has watched Vladimir Putin’s experience closely.Burns said that Xi had been ""sobered"" by the extent that the West was able to put economic pressure on Russia and support the Ukrainian forces. He said that China’s first priority will be economic recovery and reengagement with the world as it comes out of zero COVID.Haines delivered a speech to U.S. lawmakers summarizing the findings of the U.S. intelligence community’s Annual Threat Assessment report, which said that 2023 would likely see more Chinese crossings over the Taiwan Strait median line, and further Chinese missile launches over Taiwan, but that the intelligence community believes that China aims to preserve stability in East Asia.

In the House, companion legislation for the lend-lease program was introduced by Representative Michelle Steele of California.The bill, named as the “Taiwan Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2023,” takes its name and inspiration from the Lend-Lease Act of 1941, signed into law by Franklin Roosevelt during World War II. The 1941 bill authorized the gift of food, fuel, weapons, and other materials to allied nations, on the basis that such provisions were vitally necessary for the defense of the U.S. during wartime.In a similar form, the 2023 bill calls for material support to be lent or leased to Taiwan, with a focus on articles essential for Taiwan’s national defense. The bill also calls for Congress to conduct a survey of Taiwan’s defense needs and expedite procedures to ensure the rapid supply of weapons and other materials.Members of Congress were quoted in a press release explaining the importance of the new legislation.“Taiwan must have the capacity to defend itself against an invasion from Communist China. The brave Taiwanese people are a shining example of democracy in the Indo-Pacific — a stark contrast to Xi Jinping’s tyrannical regime that commits gross human rights abuses. I’m proud to join my colleagues on this good bill to strengthen Taiwanese forces and continue to show that we refuse to bow to Xi’s aggression,” said Senator Scott.Steel said, “There is no doubt that the CCP is the greatest threat to global stability and America’s national security.” The legislation “will send an unmistakable message to the CCP that the United States stands with our allies and is prepared to arm Taiwan with the tools it needs to defend itself from a CCP attack.

It is mandatory that firms trading on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) and Taipei Exchange (TPEx) publish information about events of significance that can impact share prices.Cybersecurity incidents are categorized as such events, while failing to reveal relevant information two hours before the trading session the next day will be deemed a violation.

            Taiwan’s dense air defense and anti-ship missile systems are enough to cause serious damage to Chinese forces, Liberty Times cited the official as saying. He pointed out that Taiwan’s Navy would launch heavy torpedoes from submarines, anti-ship missiles from ships, and use land-based, extended-range anti-ship missiles in a saturation attack on Chinese targets, the official said.

            This kind of tactic, which involves strikes from different directions and locations, is meant to catch the enemy by surprise, they said. The official pointed out that Taiwan has simulated offensive and defensive scenarios and live-fire tests based on different situations during Han Kuang exercises over the years.

He pointed out that Taiwan’s Navy would launch heavy torpedoes from submarines, anti-ship missiles from ships, and use land-based, extended-range anti-ship missiles in a saturation attack on Chinese targets, the official said.This kind of tactic, which involves strikes from different directions and locations, is meant to catch the enemy by surprise, they said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831433,Micronesia’s president implores lawmakers to switch recognition from China to Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Federated States of Micronesia's (FSM) outgoing President David W. Panuelo met Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) in February and negotiated terms for switching diplomatic relations from China to Taiwan, according to a letter he wrote to senior members of his government on Thursday (March 9).The 13-page letter claims that NT$1.5 billion (US$50 million), an additional US$15 million annually, healthcare, scholarships, and training programs “can, and will” be received by the FSM “if and when” the country switches diplomatic relations from China to Taiwan. Wu confirmed to the legislature on Friday afternoon (March 10) that he had ""indeed contacted and exchanged views"" with Panuelo, per UDN.A ministry spokesperson told Taiwan News they could not confirm whether or not a physical meeting had taken place.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) did not respond to questions about the reported sums, but issued a statement saying it respects and welcomes the expansion of bilateral relations. ""Taiwan shares core values ... with like-minded countries that care about peace in the Pacific region,"" the statement said.Panuelo's letter also outlines a raft of allegations directed at Chinese officials who Panuelo says engaged in “political warfare,” claiming that China offering bribes to FSM officials is a common practice. He wrote that China was using the bribes to pressure his government to isolate Taiwan and build support for an eventual Chinese invasion.As a remote Pacific Island country, FSM is reliant on aid funding as its primary source of revenue. Panuelo said that given the importance of foreign transfers to his country, and his desire to rid the country of Chinese interference, he felt obliged to see if a better deal could be achieved by switching diplomatic recognition from China to Taiwan.Panuelo said he met with Wu in February to discuss the terms of a diplomatic switch. They also reportedly discussed what benefits FSM could receive in exchange for building on the existing informal relationship, such as establishing a Taipei Economic & Cultural Representative Office (TECRO).“I was transparent with Foreign Minister Wu; we project we need an injection of approximately NT$50,000,000 to meet our future needs,” the letter reads. “We can and will receive this, over a three-year period, if and when we establish diplomatic relations with Taiwan.”Panuelo said that an additional US$15 million in assistance would be granted by Taiwan annually, to be used at the FSM government’s discretion. “Additionally, Taiwan assures me that they will simply ‘pick-up’ any and all projects that China is currently undertaking … using Micronesian labor and Micronesian businesses, unlike China,” the letter said.Panuelo said that he had invited a Taiwan International Development Cooperation Fund (ICDF) team to visit his country in March to survey how Taiwan could provide agricultural development assistance. The two sides also discussed medical referrals to Taiwan for FSM people, and scholarships and job training for FSM students.Panuelo said the monetary assistance was not the only benefit his country would receive. He said switching to Taiwan would protect his country from China, which had “demonstrated a keen capability to undermine our sovereignty, rejects our values, and uses our elected and senior officials for their own purposes.”Despite Penuelo’s interest in pursuing diplomatic relations with Taiwan, he lost his seat in a general election on Tuesday (March 7) and will be out of office in May. Penuelo’s expected successor, Peter Christian, was previously the FSM president between 2015 and 2019, per RNZ.If FSM switched diplomatic recognition to Taiwan, it would not be the first Pacific Island country to do so, with Nauru switching back to Taiwan in 2005 after it had rejected the country for China only three years earlier.",2023/3/10,1677,Politics

He said the surface-to-air missiles mounted on the ships created an ""anti-access/area denial engagement zone"" that discouraged warplanes from other countries from entering for fear of being shot down.Although Washington's priority is to deter Beijing from invading, Wilsbach said the military needs to have contingencies in the event China does attack Taiwan. He argued that if hostilities do break out, the first order of business is that, ""We've got to sink the ships.""The commander said that sinking Chinese warships should not only be the main objective of the PACAF ""but really anyone that's going to be involved in a conflict like this.""

            “As the United States seeks to strengthen our position in the Indo-Pacific, let us commit to Taiwan as a long-term ally,” Auchincloss said while addressing the House of Representatives.

            He said the scope and severity of the Chinese threat toward Taiwan has “crystallized.” However, Taiwan’s vibrant democracy and prosperous economy present an opportunity for cooperation with the U.S., particularly in countering disinformation and propaganda.

            “We should also strengthen one another’s economies to increase flows of trade and investment, by negotiating expanded market access, common rules, and the end of double taxation on Taiwanese investment in the United States,” he added. This is especially important as the U.S. tries to build up its semiconductor manufacturing industry.











            The representative was part of a congressional delegation that visited Taiwan last month. Over the course of five days, the group, led by Representative Ro Khanna, met with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and other government and military officials to discuss bilateral security and economic and trade developments, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4831508,Australian media urges country to prepare for war with China in 3 years,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — This week, two Australian newspapers, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, warned the country to prepare for war with China in the next three years.The report indicates that a conflict involving Taiwan and China is much more likely than most Australian citizens realize. Further, given the country’s alliance with the U.S., it would be very difficult for Australia to avoid involvement in a war.The independent report, entitled “Red Alert,” was authored by five security analysts and published by the Nine Entertainment media group. The general view of the analysts is that Australia is not ready to be drawn into a war involving China and Taiwan, but that the country should begin preparing with a sense of urgency.“Our assessment of the risk of war is based on President Xi Jinping’s aggressive stance and rapid military build-up,” the Red Alert report reads. It suggests a three-year time frame because, according to the analysis, “a tipping point” will be reached around 2027, after which “Beijing will have military superiority over the U.S. in the Taiwan Strait.”The analysts also factor in China’s demographic crisis. They suggest that from Xi’s perspective, there is only a limited window in which China will be capable of pursuing such a large scale military operation. Such an analysis also infers that, if conflict is unavoidable, it is more favorable to the U.S. if war in the Taiwan Strait begins sooner rather than later.If war does occur, Australian involvement may not have broad support among Australians.While some dissent is to be expected, on the issue of whether the Australian government would support the U.S. and Taiwan in a conflict, one analyst, Mick Ryan said the decision has already been made. “We have made our choice. If the United States goes to war with Taiwan, we are going to support them one way or the other,” he said.Australia finds itself in a precarious position, because its greatest trading partner is also the greatest potential threat to its sovereignty. The analysts believe that Canberra would not be able to resist involvement because the consequences of allowing China to conquer Taiwan would imperil the regional and global order, and thereby, Australia’s own livelihood.“Any attack on Taiwan is neither a marginal matter nor a local one. If successful, it would strike at the heart of global norms that have underpinned international security and prosperity . . . South-East Asia and the Pacific island states could then be dominated by Beijing. Australia’s commercial and security lifelines to the world would operate only at Beijing’s pleasure. Australia would be highly vulnerable to economic coercion, military intrusion or both,” states the report.The key points of the Red Alert report can be viewed here.",2023/3/10,4208,Politics

However, recent media reports suggested the level of financial aid coming from the European Union and from the German authorities might not be sufficient to persuade the company to set up shop, CNA reported.Instead, Singapore was willing to offer tax benefits and subsidies for the use of water and electricity, benefiting the production of 12 inch wafers for memory chips, the report said.Responding to the media discussions, TSMC said it was still evaluating the setting up of a fab for automotive chips in Europe based on the needs of customers and on the level of support from government.

On Friday (March 10), UDN reported that China’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) acknowledged that a man had been rescued by the Coast Guard and was taken immediately to a hospital.

A legislator representing Kinmen, Jessica Chen (陳玉珍), made a video press release on Friday afternoon addressing the missing soldier. She said the soldier was suffering from psychological problems and that it was a simple case of desertion and that he should not be considered a communist.The TAO office has not yet confirmed the identity of the person who was rescued. However, Jessica Chen indicated that the soldier was wearing a life jacket and totally exhausted when he was discovered by a Chinese Coast Guard patrol boat not far from the tiny island of Sandan, about halfway between Erdan and the coast of Fujian.As a representative of Kinmen, Chen said she is prepared to coordinate with the Chinese side to resolve the issue. She also called on the central government to pay more attention to the condition of frontline soldiers and do more to ensure their morale and psychological health.UDN also reported that the county executive of Kinmen, Chen Fu-hai (陳福海), has made efforts to resolve the issue.

            In the 13-page letter, Panuelo detailed the impact of China's political warfare and gray zone activities in FSM, as well as the egregious behavior of Chinese diplomats in the country.

Some have production facilities in China.The Dutch government has never granted ASML a licence to sell its most advanced machines to customers in China, following pressure from Washington, which is seeking to hobble China's ability to make its own advanced computer chips and to slow down its military advances.ASML's lithography systems can cost up to 160 million euros ($170 million) each and are used to create the circuitry of computer chips.The Dutch government on Wednesday announced new restrictionson exports impacting ASML's second-best range of chip-printing tools, which could lead to Chinese retaliation.SINGAPORE HEADQUARTERS?Among the companies on the mission is Neways, which helps ASML develop electrical control units, power controls and wiring systems for lithography systems, according to the company's website.A spokesperson for Neways declined comment.ASML supplier NTS Group, which is a provider of precision mechanics tools, is another company that will join the business trip, Brainport said.The other companies on the trip are Bestronics, AAE BV, BKB Precision, HQ Group, KMWE Group, Sempro, Sioux Technologies and VDL ETG, according to one of the documents and Brainport.""VDL Groep has different branches in Asia ... We have no intention at all of leaving China,"" the company said in a statement.Other companies could not be reached for comment on Friday.Singapore is being considered as a potential location for regional headquarters, the note said.ASML declined comment.One person familiar with the organisation of the trip said one of the companies was in advanced talks with partners in Vietnam to build a factory.A second company was also likely to invest there, the person said declining to name the firms and to be named because the information was confidential.A second person involved in the organisation of the trip said that Malaysia was also a likely choice for new investment because some of the companies already have facilities there.",2023/3/11,807,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4832013,"Li Qiang, Xi confidant, takes reins as China's premier","Four years before Li Qiang gained notoriety as the force behind the two-month COVID-19 lockdown of Shanghai, the man who became China's new premier on Saturday worked quietly behind the scenes to drive a bold revamp of the megacity's sclerotic stock market.Li's back-channelling - sources said he bypassed the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which lost some of its power under the new set-up - demonstrated what became a reputation for pragmatism as well as close ties with President Xi Jinping.In late 2018, Xi himself announced Shanghai's new tech-focused STAR Market as well as the pilot of a registration-based IPO system, reforms meant to entice China's hottest young firms to list locally rather than overseas.""The CSRC was very unhappy,"" said a veteran banker close to regulators and Shanghai officials, declining to be named given the sensitivity of the matter.""Li's relationship with Xi played a role here,"" enabling him to present the scheme directly to the central government, without going through the CSRC, the person added.The CSRC did not respond to a request for comment.Previously the Communist Party chief in Shanghai, Li was confirmed as premier during the National People's Congress, charged with managing the world's second largest economy. He replaced the retiring Li Keqiang, widely perceived to have been sidelined as Xi tightened his grip on management of the economy.Leadership watchers say Li Qiang's closeness to Xi is both a strength and a vulnerability: while he has Xi's trust, he is beholden to his long-time patron.Trey McArver, co-founder of consultancy Trivium China, said Li is likely to be much more powerful than his predecessor.Xi expended significant political capital to get him into the role, given Li's lack of central government experience and the Shanghai lockdown, McArver said.""Officials know that Li Qiang is Xi Jinping's guy,"" he said.""He clearly thinks that Li Qiang is a very competent person and he has put him in this position because he trusts him and he expects a lot of him.""Li, 63, did not respond to questions sent to China's State Council Information Office.PRACTICAL PRAGMATISTA career bureaucrat, Li was revealed as the pick for China's number two role in October when Xi unveiled a leadership line-up stacked with loyalists.At that time, Li had been known for overseeing the harrowing COVID lockdown earlier last year of Shanghai's 25 million people, which shut the city's economy and left psychological scars among its residents. That made him a target of anger but did nothing to derail his promotion.Li was also instrumental in pushing for China's unexpectedly sudden end to its zero-COVID policy late last year, Reuters reported this month.People who have interacted with Li say they found him practical-minded, an effective bureaucratic operator and supportive of the private sector - a stance that would be expected in someone whose career put him in charge of some of China's most economically dynamic regions.As Communist Party chief between 2002 to 2004 in his home city of Wenzhou, a hotbed of entrepreneurialism, Li came across as open-minded and willing to listen, said Zhou Dewen, who represented small and midsize enterprises in the city.""He took a liberal approach of granting private companies default access to enter the market, except when explicitly banned by law, rather then the traditional approach of keeping private companies out by default,"" said Zhou.Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council and a former U.S. official, said Li sought to level the playing field for foreign businesses, pointing to the speed with which U.S. carmaker Tesla was able to get its Shanghai factory there operational in 2019.""Clearly nothing got in the way once a decision was made. There was a clarity of a kind in his decision making, an authority, and that really helps,"" said Allen, describing Li as comfortable in his own skin.Still, several observers caution against putting too much weight on Li's experience in a business hub such as Shanghai, since Xi has steadily tightened Communist Party control and taken the economy in a more statist direction.""Now Li is a national leader, working under a market-sceptic boss, and he has to balance growth with a range of social, technological, and geopolitical goals,"" said Neil Thomas, senior analyst at Eurasia.NO WALLFLOWEREven by the opaque standards of Chinese politics, there is little public information about Li's background or personal life.Born in Ruian county in what is now Wenzhou, the 17-year-old Li went to work in 1976 at an irrigation station in his hometown, a desirable job in what turned out to be the final year of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution.Li entered Zhejiang Agricultural University in 1978, the year that campuses were reopened in China and competition for places was fierce. He received master's degrees from the central party school in Beijing and Hong Kong Polytechnic University.It was in Zhejiang, home to some of China's biggest private companies - where Xi was provincial party secretary and Li was his chief of staff between 2004 and 2007 - that the two men would have built their personal bond.American author Robert Lawrence Kuhn, who met Li and Xi together in 2005 and 2006, said the two shared an easy rapport.""Unlike most other staffers of top leaders, Li was no wallflower,"" Kuhn told Reuters.""In the presence of Xi, he felt comfortable and confident enough to put himself forward to engage me, which tells me he is not worried his boss might think he is trying to steal his limelight,"" Kuhn said.However, leadership watchers said there are limits to what Li will be able to do.""Li can make some repairs here and there, but he won't tear down the wall and build something new,"" said Chen Daoyin, former associate professor at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, and now a commentator based in Chile.(Reporting by Yew Lun Tian, Laurie and Chen Joe Cash; Additional reporting by the Shanghai newsroom and Julie Zhu in Hong Kong; Editing by Tony Munroe and Lincoln Feast)",2023/3/11,662,Politics

It was not until she tried a convenience store that she found two cartons which she bought for NT$172.Yeh said she thought it was a small matter and did not want to waste police resources, but because it was reported to the police and larceny is a publicly prosecutable offense, they investigated the case.

Prior to the meeting, Chiu confirmed to the media that Chen is in China.In the Legislative Yuan session, Chiu said that in addition to launching a search effort for Chen, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) conducted an inventory of equipment, while the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) scanned nearby waters. He said that on Friday evening (March 10) notice was received that Chen was in Xiamen, China.Legislators questioned whether poor communication channels between Taiwan and China could have led to the inefficient handling of Chen's disappearance.

The deity appeared in the shrine during the former Democratic Progressive Party Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan’s (鄭文燦) time in office, and has been sent back to Japan by his successor, Kuomintang (KMT) Mayor Chang San-cheng (張善政).The Martyr's Shrine complex was built by the Japanese government during the colonial period (1895-1945) as a traditional Shinto shrine, but became the Taoyuan County Martyrs’ Shrine under the Kuomintang, following its takeover of Taiwan in 1949. The shrine is dedicated to soldiers who died in armed conflicts, which were mostly a result of conflict with Japan.KMT legislator for Taoyuan Niu Hsu-ting (牛煦庭) said the previous mayoral administration had not properly considered the potential impact when allowing Japanese deities into the park. “Cheng Wen-tsan’s city government … allowed manufacturers to make decisions about welcoming gods and offering sacrifices based on purely commercial considerations, which lacks sufficient oversight,” he said, posing in Facebook on Monday (March 13).DPP Legislator Huang Chiung-hui (黃瓊慧) responded to Niu’s comments and said that despite the concerns of critics, Amaterasu did not represent war, that the removal was politically motivated, and was without civic merit. “As a native of Taoyuan, I have already learned how to respect and tolerate various multi-ethnic cultures, and ideology is not my first consideration for sightseeing,” she wrote, also on Facebook on Monday.Taoyuan Martyrs' Shrine is one of the best-preserved examples of a Japanese Shinto shrine outside of Japan.

However, in December, Zhao stopped appearing at Foreign Ministry press conferences, and it was later revealed that he had been demoted to the post of deputy director of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs Department.On March 9, Weibo user ""Lovey Zhao Shushu"" (可愛多趙蜀黍) posted an image of Zhao standing next to a Qing Dynasty (1644–1911) stele marking a boundary in Guangxi Province. On March 10, the Weibo user posted a photo of Zhao and an unidentified official standing next to another boundary marker in Guangxi identifying the boundary with Vietnam.The next day, the Weibo account posted a photo of Zhao dressed in casual clothes while painting a border pillar in Aijiang Village, Daxin County, Chongzuo, Guangxi, which is also along the boundary with Vietnam. Many Chinese netizens mocked Zhao's substantially reduced role:""Demoted a thousand miles away?""""Where the motherland needs me to go, I will absolutely go there!""""I wonder how some people can talk nonsense while keeping a straight face?"" If you tell too many lies, you will have a split personality.""Twitter user Teacher Li is not Your Teacher (李老師不是你老師), a key figure who promoted the White Paper Revolution, on March 10 posted the image of Zhao standing next to the Qing Dynasty stele, prompting ridicule by followers:""He really was demoted to the very bottom.""""He brought us a lot of fun when he was in the limelight. I miss him!""""I'm sneaking around having fun, please do not disturb.""Some China observers believe that Zhao was possibly demoted because of what were deemed to be inappropriate remarks by his wife, Tang Tianru (湯天如). Many Chinese netizens discovered a series of photos of Tang traveling to Germany in June 2022, while ordinary Chinese were under harsh travel restrictions and expressing her appreciation for what she considered a ""normal life"" there.In another post uploaded in December, Tang complained about the lack of fever medication in China and felt ""helpless,"" prompting some to interpret this as meaning that Zhao was infected with COVID.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4833644,"UK approves increased submarine-related exports to Taiwan, risking angering China","Britain approved a sharp increase in exports of submarine parts and technology last year to Taiwan as it upgrades its naval forces, a move that could impact British ties with China.The value of licences granted by the British government to companies for the export of submarine-related components and technology to Taiwan totalled a record 167 million pounds ($201.29 million) during the first nine months of last year, according to UK government export licensing data. That is more than the previous six years combined, a Reuters analysis of the data showed.The data is publicly accessible but the most recent Taiwan-related figures haven’t previously been reported.Beijing considers Taiwan part of China, known as the One-China policy, and strongly objects to perceived foreign interference with the island believing it to be support for Taiwan’s desire to be recognised as its own country.When presented with the figures by Reuters, China’s foreign ministry said in a statement: ""If this is true, it is a serious violation of the one-China principle, undermines China's sovereignty and security interests, and undermines peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.”“China is highly concerned about this and firmly opposes it,” said the written statement, which urged Britain to “refrain from providing military support to the Taiwan authorities.”Britain does not recognise Taiwan and has no formal diplomatic relations with the island but it maintains economic and trade ties and there is a de facto British embassy in Taipei.A British government spokesperson said in a statement the UK has a long record of “granting licences for exports of controlled goods to Taiwan, on a case-by-case basis, where those applications are consistent with the rules that regulate the exports of arms and dual-use products.”""We consider the Taiwan issue one to be settled peacefully by the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait through constructive dialogue, without the threat or use of force or coercion,"" the statement added.The increase in licences granted reflects greater demand from Taiwan, two government officials said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.Two lawmakers with knowledge of the exports and two former officials said the approvals reflected Britain’s increased willingness to support Taiwan. One of the lawmakers, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said authorising the export licences amounted to giving a ""green light"" to better equip Taiwan.The data is from the Export Control Organisation, which is responsible for export licensing and sits within the UK Department for International Trade. It shows the government authorised 25 export licences to Taiwan during the first nine months of 2022 under the categories ""components for submarines"" and ""technology for submarines.""The data doesn’t disclose which companies received the authorisation or detail what specific equipment it covers.One licence type, called ML9, covers “vessels of war, special naval equipment, accessories, components, and other surface vessels,"" according to Britain’s list of strategic military items that require export authorisation. Another license type, ML22, includes technology that is required for the development, production, operation, installation, maintenance, repair or goods or software.The British government on Monday announced a boost to defence spending as it unveiled an update to its defence, security and foreign policy priorities, setting out how it plans to “tackle new threats” from China and Russia.HEIGHTENED TENSIONSMilitary tensions between Beijing and Taipei are at their highest in decades. Taiwan, some 100 miles south east from the Chinese coast, has said it is building a fleet of submarines to build up their naval defences. Taiwan has for decades been unable to buy conventional submarines from other countries because of their concerns of angering China.Taiwan’s democratically-elected government strongly rejects China’s sovereignty claims, saying only the island’s people can decide their future.As Reuters previously reported, an array of foreign submarine-technology vendors, with the approval of their governments, have been aiding the program.In response to a request for comment about the submarine-related exports from Britain, Taiwan’s defence ministry said in a statement that its ship-building programme was ""a major national policy, and the navy has promoted various projects in a pragmatic way under it.""""We hope that all walks of life will continue to give their support, to jointly maintain the security and peace of the Taiwan Strait,"" the ministry said.Taipei aims to test its first prototype by September and deliver the first of the planned eight vessels by 2025.Britain’s granting of submarine-related licences began to tick up after Taiwan announced it planned to build the submarine fleet in 2017.Britain approved the export of 87 million pounds worth of submarine components and technology to Taiwan in 2020, up from 31,415 pounds in 2017 and none in 2016, according to the licensing data. The value of such licences approved in 2021 dipped to just under 9 million pounds.UK 'TILT' TO INDO-PACIFICBritain’s Integrated Review, a document laying out the country’s defence, security and foreign policy priorities that was published in March 2021, specified a “tilt” to the Indo-Pacific but didn’t mention Taiwan.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year has raised questions in Britain and elsewhere in the West about other possible future flash points around the world.Britain’s defence minister, Ben Wallace, told Reuters last month that the West’s actions in support of Kyiv was a signal to other countries that grabbing land does not pay off. ""This conflict is important because the world is watching whether the West will stand up for its values of freedom, democracy, liberal societies and the rule of law,"" he said.Western lawmakers and other officials have been stepping up their visits to Taiwan, despite Beijing's objections. That included one in November by Britain’s then minister of state for trade, Greg Hands. ""We urge the British side to stop any form of official exchanges with Taiwan and stop sending wrong signals to separatist forces for Taiwan independence,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at the time.Tobias Ellwood, head of the UK parliament’s defence committee and a member in Britain’s governing Conservative Party who visited Taiwan in December, told Reuters the British government had to be careful about what detail it publicly provides about the equipment covered by the export licences.""An announcement of the specific nature of these exports risks revealing sensitive information on Taiwan's defensive capabilities and some of the UK government's caution in discussing these exports is valid,"" Ellwood said.One of the former British officials said: ""Every decision around Taiwan is made very deliberately and usually cautiously."" Asked about the decision to approve the increase in export licences, the official said: ""You just don't do something like this without thinking through the implications very carefully.""($1 = 0.8297 pounds)(Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in Taipei, Martin Quin Pollard in Beijing and Andy Bruce and Paul Sandle in London; editing by Cassell Bryan-Low)",2023/3/13,1958,Politics

He added that China does not forbid Taiwanese from traveling to China independently, CNA reported.Chiu explained that since Aug. 1, 2019, China has banned its people from visiting Taiwan for independent travel for political reasons and that Taiwan is not currently included in China’s list of oversea destinations that are open to Chinese tour groups. The opening up of cross-strait tourism must be reciprocal, Chu said, adding that Lee should instead ask China why it banned its people from traveling to Taiwan independently.Deputy Minister of Transportation and Communications Chi Wen-chung (祁文中) said the opening of tourism will benefit both sides of the strait, but it needs to be opened on a reciprocal basis. With China not allowing tour groups to go to Taiwan at this point, Taiwan, of course, will not allow its tour groups to visit China.Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Chuang Jui-hsiung (莊瑞雄) said that it was China that took the initiative to ban its tour groups and independent travelers from coming to Taiwan, per CNA.",2023/3/13,1357,Politics

Due to budgetary reasons, the program can not cover all locations but mobile equipment could be brought in, CNA quoted Digital Ministry Audrey Tang (唐鳳) as saying.The main objective is to ensure that when a conflict occurs, communication services, including video conferencing, internet phone calls, and live broadcasting, remain available. This will allow the president to address the nation and the country to keep the communication channels open with allies such as the U.S. and Japan, officials explained.The move follows the severing of two submarine cables connecting Taiwan and its outlying Matsu islands last month, allegedly by Chinese vessels and disrupting the islands’ communications services. Protecting undersea cables has become a priority as Chunghwa Telecom reported 27 instances of cuts in Taiwan’s undersea cables over the past five years.The importance of uninterrupted internet connectivity has also been brought to the fore by the war in Ukraine.

The victims included Kaohsiung City Councillor Huang Jie (黃捷), Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Kao Chia-yu (高嘉瑜), and influencer Ili Cheng (鄭家純).Chu was arrested in October 2021 after police discovered the content on Telegram. He and Chuang were eventually sentenced to more than five year and three year sentences respectively for violating the Personal Data Protection Act, offenses of public demeanor, and aggravated defamation.In addition to the compensation orders issued on Monday and the prison sentences already handed down, the pair were previously ordered to pay damages of NT$5 million each to five of the most high-profile figures involved in the case for the “anxiety and severe mental trauma” caused.

Jail sentences for the recording of and blackmail involving sexually explicit images were also increased, with sentences increasing by half if profit was involved.One of the victims, a Taiwanese influencer named Zamy (奎丁) responded to the news of the additional compensation orders with contempt, saying that the amount was humiliating to the victims. “Can’t you lock him up for longer?” she wrote in an Instagram story on Monday.According to a 2019 report, non-consensual deepfake pornography accounts for 96% of the deepfake videos online, and women represent the overwhelming majority of victims of deepfaked sexually explicit material.

However, on Monday (March 13), the 29-year-old man disappeared at around 11 a.m. and police contacted his family and began a search, reported UDN.Wu Jui-pao (吳瑞寶), deputy warden of the Ministry of Justice Department of Correction Changhua Prison, told the news service that Chu was sentenced to four years, one month, and five days. He started serving his sentence on Dec. 24, 2019, and it was set to end on Jan. 4, 2024.In 2021, due to good behavior, he was selected to perform work outside the prison. On Monday morning, Chu went to work at a glass factory in the Changhua Binhai Industrial Zone as usual, but when others were not paying attention during his lunch break, he fled the scene.According to the court's ruling, Chu is a repeat offender, having committed multiple thefts. He has reportedly stolen bicycles, delivery vans, prizes from crane game shops, items from floral design shops, cash from stores, and merchandise from convenience stores.From Aug. 10-20, 2019, alone, Chu committed 18 acts of theft. Although he claimed he only committed the thefts due to difficulty finding work because of his lack of schooling and that he was divorced, raising a daughter, and taking care of a handicapped mother, the court ruled that he did not express adequate remorse, and he did not respect other people's property rights.However, because he did not commit any violent crimes, the court sentenced him to four years, one month, and five days in prison.On Tuesday morning (March 14), officers from the Yuanlin station of the Changhua County Police Bureau arrested Chu, reported TVBS.

Cheng said he began working with EVs when he was asked to collaborate with Chinese companies in 2015, which led him to work on building the Nio EV brand.Cheng said Nio developed an EV to production stage in 30 months, when normally it would take a new company three to four years. He said that MIH hopes to help other EV startups develop vehicles in similarly short timeframes by developing an open architecture upon which new EV companies can build their end user product.Cheng used the example of the Jaguar X-type, built on the same platform as the Ford Mondeo, a basic family wagon. Manufacturers with very different end users were able to develop vehicles that suited their customers’ needs using the same basic platform.“There are ... a lot of new brands for EVs, they never get the components or the architecture platform to begin,"" Cheng said. “It’s such a rigid process for them to go bidding and do all this benchmarking and try to get a business where there is already a supply base for the traditional guy.”Cheng said that MIH creates a “half complete” vehicle, akin to a simple battery pack on wheels. Companies can then take this platform and build on it, adapting the form to their user base.MIH was founded by Taiwan's electronics giant Foxconn, which purchased an EV production facility in Ohio in May last year to manufacture the EV platform. In November 2022, the company broke ground on an EV production facility in Thailand, which reportedly will also be a production base for the MIH platform.",2023/3/14,730,Business

            Baptiste, who is visiting Taiwan, said he is here to “renew our commitment to our bilateral relations.” The opening of its embassy in 2015 is a “mark of respect” and proves that Saint Lucia is “here to develop true friendship,” Baptiste said.

            Saint Lucia cooperates with Taiwan and helps it participate in international organizations, he said. At the U.N. General Assembly, Saint Lucia’s vocal support is “a clear manifestation of our level of interest in seeing Taiwan participate meaningfully in international theaters,” the foreign minister said.

            Baptiste told Taiwan News that his country has been hit hard by many challenges over the decades, including ones related to the economy and climate change. As a result, there has been a decline in official development and climate change has decimated many aspects of Saint Lucian society, he said.











            Therefore, international cooperation is vital for a “small, open, and vulnerable economy” like Saint Lucia to survive and prosper. “It is only through international cooperation where countries large and small can cooperate under their respective mandates to bring about change,” he said.

            This is why partnering with Taiwan is such a big deal, Baptiste argued. Taiwan has intervened directly and improved the quality of life for everyone in Saint Lucia, he said.

            There is a personal relationship between Taiwan and the people of Saint Lucia, Baptiste said, adding that “it will be very difficult to break that bond of friendship.”

            In response to Taiwan’s call to defend freedom and democracy against expanding authoritarianism, Saint Lucia has “undoubtedly” followed suit, Baptiste said. He said his country allows people to “say whatever they want and without being tortured for honest opinion.”

            Even those who spread propaganda and criticize the nation, the government allows them to do it, he said. He noted that freedom of speech has been utilized as a weapon, but recommended that “we must never focus on the negatives of that freedom of expression.”

            Baptiste emphasized that a major goal of Prime Minister Philip J. Pirre is to have people “gainfully employed,” which is why it recently launched the Youth Economy Programme.

            The program aims to offer Saint Lucian youth the opportunity to participate in the economy and open up new avenues for economic growth and development, he said. It also allows young people to “sit around the table as equal and valuable partners in the development of our country.”

            The foreign minister said Saint Lucia is developing a partnership with the people and government of Taiwan and urged more bilateral investment and exchanges to bolster friendship.

            Additionally, Minister for Youth Development and Sports Kenson J. Casimir said that the Youth Economy Programme allows young Saint Lucians with innovative ideas an easier way of getting startup funds by providing soft loans “interest free and hassle free.”

            He expressed gratitude to Taiwan for donating funds to the program early on before it was officially launched.

            Casimir also said his ministry has established a platform called Skill 758, which lets individuals with qualifications upload their resume and certification online, thus giving the government “an idea on what our skill component is in Saint Lucia, and what we need to work on.”

            The platform helps the ministry identify gaps in education, where it can swoop in and provide training for individuals who desire to be certified in a particular field, Casimir said.

            Baptiste’s delegation, which also includes Senator Lisa C. Jawahir, arrived on Monday (March 13) and has already met with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文). Baptiste and Tsai oversaw the signing of a bilateral agreement on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters at the Presidential Office.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835523,Honduras set to switch ties from Taiwan to China,"Update-- Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Tah-ray Yui (俞大㵢) met with Honduran Ambassador to Taiwan Harold Burgos on Tuesday morning (March 15), expressing serious concern over Honduras President Xiomara Castro's decision to establish diplomatic ties with China, per a Ministry of Foreign Affairs press release.
Yui reiterated that Taiwan and Honduras have been friends for more than 80 years. Over the years, Taiwan has promoted many cooperation projects with the Honduran government to benefit the people of the two countries, he said. 
""Taiwan is a sincere and reliable ally of Honduras,"" he said.
""The government and people of Taiwan have always assisted in Honduras' development and construction within the scope of their capabilities and have lent a helping hand when it was most needed,"" Yui added, which is in contrast to the ""flashy promises"" made by the Chinese dictatorship.
Beijing intends to wrest control of Taiwan's diplomatic relations and reduce Taiwan's international space, the vice minister said. He reminded Honduras to carefully consider its decision and not to ""fall into China's trap"" by damaging the long-term friendship between Taiwan and Honduras.
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Honduras President Xiomara Castro announced on Tuesday (March 14) that she will establish diplomatic relations with China.

            Castro revealed in a tweet that she had instructed Honduras Foreign Minister Eduardo Reina to oversee the process of forming official ties with Beijing. She justified her decision as being “a sign of my determination to fulfill the government plan and expand borders.”

            Castro had pledged to recognize Beijing during her presidential campaign but seemingly backtracked once she took office.

            Chinese Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Xie Feng (謝峰) met with Reina in January when the two both attended Brazilian President Lula da Silva’s inauguration. The two ministers reportedly discussed potential cooperation on the Patuca II hydropower project in Honduras.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835599,China obstructs new subsea cable to Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A British newspaper on Tuesday (March 14) cited several sources as saying China is obstructing the laying and maintenance of submarine internet cables in the South China Sea by delaying approvals and other means, delaying a cable connecting Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan for more than a year.According to Financial Times, China is attempting to interfere with and control the transnational telecommunications infrastructure in the South China Sea. The scope of Beijing's attempts to control undersea networks covers nearly the entire South China Sea.The report pointed out China has been delaying the review process, tightening conditions for obtaining various permits, and even extending the scope of its control beyond China's internationally recognized territorial waters. Industry insiders say this forces companies to avoid the South China Sea, which incurs additional costs.Two corporate managers told the newspaper that a cable under construction, the Southeast Asia-Japan Cable 2 (SJC2), has been delayed for more than a year because of Chinese opposition and lags in obtaining permits for seabed exploration. When completed, SJC2 will connect Japan with South Korea, China, Taiwan (Fangshan Township and Tamsui District), Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Thailand.According to the report, SJC2 is owned by a consortium whose members include China Mobile, Chunghwa Telecom, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook. For months, China has held off on approving seabed exploration in Chinese territorial waters around Hong Kong, citing concerns including possible espionage by contractors, said a person directly involved in the project, who asked not to be named.Bryan Clark, a former U.S. Navy official and a senior fellow at Washington-based Hudson Institute, said one of the reasons China is trying to tighten control of underwater activities in the area is to prevent American surveillance systems from being included in the subsea cable installation. He added that Beijing also ""wants to know exactly where civilian undersea infrastructure is installed for its own mapping purposes.""The report said various disputes surrounding submarine cables have escalated rapidly since 2020, when the U.S. began to prevent China from participating in international consortium projects. The U.S. has also rejected plans to lay cables connecting the U.S. with China and Hong Kong.The article noted that according to international law, if the scope of a subsea project falls within the territorial waters of a country's coast, the country or company that lays and maintains the cable must obtain permission from the coastal state. Although the construction in the ""exclusive economic zone"" EEZ extending 12 to 200 miles from the territory of the coastal state usually does not require a permit, China has recently begun demanding companies apply for permits in its EEZ, apparently contravening international maritime law.A person familiar with the matter told CNA on Tuesday that the SJC2 submarine cable invested in by Chunghwa Telecom has been delayed for more than a year and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The source said in the future, new undersea cables will circumvent the South China Sea.There is speculation that Chunghwa Telecom's two Taiwan-Matsu submarine cables were deliberately cut in early February by the Chinese ships, with industry insiders pointing to two factors that raise suspicions. The two submarine cables between Taiwan and Matsu were cut within just six days of each other and the damage occurred close to Matsu.",2023/3/15,6550,Politics

When asked when the shortage will be alleviated, Chen listed several reasons why he believes it will improve significantly by April.Chen said that an increase in breeding and incubation has been implemented, the weather has begun to warm up, the bird flu has been properly controlled, and domestic production capacity has been increased, alleviating the egg shortage, reported UDN.

According to the poll, Lai was favored by 39.3% of voters, followed by Hou's 27.8% and former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je's (柯文哲) 18.2%.""There are only 65% of pan-blue poll respondents saying they would cast their vote for Hou, and that is much less satisfactory,"" he added. ""Hou should gain the support of close to 80% among the pan-blue voters to win the 2024 presidential race.""Chiang also expressed worry about the participation of Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) Chairman Ko and Foxconn Technology founder Terry Gou (郭台銘), who is now an independent, in the race. Chiang believes that would split the pan-blue voters, making the battle more difficult for the KMT.Chiang said that the KMT should decide which candidate should represent the party as fast as it can and dedicate its resources to supporting the candidate to stop losing ground.In early March, a survey by Taiwan’s Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC) with Gallup showed Lai with Vice Premier Cheng Wen-tsan (鄭文燦) as his running mate receiving 36.45% of the vote, with a combination of Gou with Ko as his running mate winning 23.59%; and Hou with Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) finishing third at 18.23%.On Thursday (March 16), Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF) Chairman Ying-lung You (游盈隆) released a survey that shows 54.3% of voters disagree with Hou's running for the 2024 presidential election in less than a year after he was elected as the New Taipei City's mayor.

Many companies in Taiwan lack the expertise, resources, and willingness required to protect their systems, a Business Today investigation has found.In an example, the system of a server at a firm that received complaints about personal data being leaked was found to be lacking any sort of safeguards. Not only was the database it held not password-protected, it also appeared without access restrictions, the report quoted a Taiwanese information security expert as saying.Jason Hsieh (謝昀澤), head of advisory services of KPMG in Taiwan, shared another example in which a company’s staff used the computer storing files of sales orders to “play video games.”Many are simply pushing their luck, said Akuei Hsu (徐富桂) of IEK Consulting, and there is also the issue of accountability and insufficient investment in cybersecurity, according to Tsai Sung-ting (蔡松廷), founder of TeamT5, a digital security services provider.The role of information security is often dwarfed by other IT elements in SMEs, such as infrastructure upgrades, which results in meager spending on security bolstering measures. According to KMPG, Taiwanese companies invest an average of 5% to 12% of their IT budget in cybersecurity, but a large proportion of SMEs do not fork out even 5%.Meanwhile, fines incurred from cybersecurity incidents are considered too lenient, discouraging expanded investment. Supervisory measures also have been criticized for being ineffective.Digital Minister Audrey Tang (唐鳳) has said the government is introducing higher penalties following the data leak events, with the Securities and Futures Bureau recently warning listed companies in Taiwan will face NT$5 million (US$163,178) in fines for not disclosing cyberattacks.

Miller joined Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) founder Morris Chang (張忠謀) on Thursday (March 16) to discuss the growing polarization of the semiconductor industry, its exponential growth, and his book, which recently won The Financial Times Business Book of the Year.Miller said it is hard to imagine a world without semiconductors, as they are now integrated into everything from refrigerators to cars to lightbulbs, per CNA. He said that people need to understand the importance of the semiconductor industry, and in order to do that, they must understand Taiwan and TSMC’s central role in the process.Miller and Chang both agreed that there was increasing polarization in the chip industry between China and the U.S. Chang said that he supports recent U.S. industrial policies designed to combat China’s growth in the semiconductor industry, despite previous harsh critiques of some aspects.During Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in 2022, Chang reportedly told the then U.S. house speaker that America's plans to enter the industry were “incredibly naive.” Washington is increasing incentives for Taiwan to expand its semiconductor manufacturing operations in the U.S., with TSMC announcing plans to up its investment in the country in December 2022.Miller also spoke about the semiconductor’s unique position as both a key driver of the global economy and a technology that grows exponentially. He said that if airplanes had doubled their speed every two years, as semiconductors have done, they would be flying at the speed of light, and that “only the semiconductor industry has really done this.”In an earlier interview with Engineering & Technology, Miller said that a Chinese annexation of Taiwan would have a “dramatic” impact on the whole world. “The risk is there because China’s military is so much stronger today, while America’s position is weaker in relative terms,” he said.",2023/3/16,1696,Business

Semafor misconstrued Robert O’Brien's claim that the U.S. allowing China to take over Taiwan was “never going to happen,” to make the claim that the U.S. would “demolish” Taiwan’s semiconductor industry rather than let China gain control.The interviewer appeared misled by an analogy O’Brien made about Britain’s decision to destroy a French Navy fleet in World War Two to avoid it falling into the hands of the Nazis. “They bombed that fleet!” the interviewer said.In February 2022, Semafor partnered with a think tank that operates under the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) United Front Work Department (UFWD), the CCP's branch responsible for promoting Chinese influence and ideas overseas. O’Brien suggested that his comments were deliberately misinterpreted in the interest of creating Chinese propaganda, per CNA.He revealed, ""The only people that will destroy Taiwan in an invasion are Communist China, and anyone who says that the U.S. is somehow going to destroy Taiwan or attack Taiwan, that's propaganda and misinformation from the Chinese Communist Party.”While O’Brien denied the U.S. would destroy TSMC, a report published by the U.S. Army War College in 2021 recommended destruction as a course of action. “The United States and Taiwan should lay plans for a targeted 'scorched-earth' strategy that would render Taiwan not just unattractive if ever seized by force, but positively costly to maintain,” the authors said.The report claimed, “This could be done most effectively by threatening to destroy facilities belonging to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company."" The report received negative reception in Taiwan and abroad, and critics quickly pointed out that publicizing such a strategy would be an “enormous boon” to the CCP’s UFWD.O’Brien said that Taiwan needs to buy more U.S. weapons and manufacture more defense equipment. Taiwan currently has a backlog of around US$19 billion (NT$589 billion) in U.S. arms purchases, since most weapons are being sent to Ukraine.""My position is that we should give the same priority to Taiwan that we're giving to Ukraine,"" O‘Brien said. “Ukraine is already in a war …but for Taiwan, we have to deter a war.""",2023/3/16,1546,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837392,Nuclear power Taiwan’s only hedge against Chinese naval blockade: Peter Zeihan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — In February, geopolitical analyst and consultant Peter Zeihan discussed the economic, demographic, and political landscape in East Asia with Taiwan News.At the conclusion of that interview, Zeihan offered two very stark warnings for Taiwan.First: Taiwanese businesses heavily invested in China need to understand how precarious those investments are, given the magnitude of the demographic and economic crisis facing China.

“I understand that the business community in Taiwan has a lot vested in China. But they're going to lose it all, every single scrap of it. And the sooner that realization is reflected in policy, the better Taiwan will be,” said Zeihan.Second: Taiwan must reconsider its policy toward green energy technologies. Most pointedly, until electricity storage using batteries is vastly improved, it is very unwise for Taiwan to abandon nuclear power. “Nuclear is (Taiwan’s) only hedge against a naval blockade,” in the event of war in the Taiwan Strait, he said.

Under the Tsai administration, the government has set the goal of decommissioning and defueling nuclear power plants by the end of 2026, with all plants to be dismantled by 2038. Given the threat posed by China and current constraints on energy production and storage, it is undoubtedly prudent for future administrations to reconsider this plan.Zeihan does make some concessions on the practical applications of the offshore wind farms which Taiwan has invested in. “It’s a better choice than solar (power),” which Zeihan contends is not at all practical for Taiwan to invest in at scale.Ultimately, Zeihan warns that in “a country that imports 90% of its energy,” green tech in its current form is “atrocious” for the physical geography of Taiwan. “Taiwan is going to be an oil, gas, coal, and nuclear country until such time as we figure out a much better battery system,” he said.As far as Taiwan’s economic and political future, Zeihan anticipates that Taipei will likely follow Tokyo’s lead in terms of forming trade blocs or making trade agreements, especially economic deals with the United States.Readers can watch the entire segment below.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837443,"Exclusive: Apple supplier Foxconn wins AirPod order, plans $200 million factory in India","TAIPEI, March 16 (Reuters) - Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn has won an order to make AirPods for Apple Inc and plans to build a factory in India to produce the wireless earphones, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The deal will see Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and assembler of around 70% of all iPhones, become an AirPod supplier for the first time and underlines efforts by the key Apple supplier to further diversify production away from China. AirPods are currently made by a range of Chinese suppliers.
One source said Foxconn will invest more than $200 million in the new India AirPod plant in the southern Indian state of Telangana. It wasn't immediately clear how much the AirPod order would be worth.
The person, who requested anonymity as the matter was not public yet, said Foxconn officials had debated internally for months about whether to assemble AirPods due to relatively lower profit margins on making the device, but ultimately opted to go ahead with the deal to ""reinforce engagement"" with Apple.
""That way, we are more likely to get orders for their new products,"" the person said.
The decision to set up production in India was requested by Apple, according to the source.
Foxconn vies with Taiwanese rivals such as Wistron Corp and Pegatron Corp to win more orders from Apple, the world's most valuable company.
A subsidiary, Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd <6088.HK>, plans to start construction of a manufacturing facility in Telangana in the second half of this year and begin production by the end of 2024 at the earliest, the person said.
Shares in the Foxconn unit jumped nearly 9% after Reuters first reported the news, reversing an earlier loss of 2.2%. Shares in Foxconn itself traded up 0.5%, while the Taipei benchmark was down 1.1%.
A second person with direct knowledge of the matter, who also declined to be identified as the matter was not yet public, said the Foxconn subsidiary will make AirPods in India without providing further details.
Analysts have previously said Apple has asked suppliers including Foxconn to make AirPods in India, but details such as the size of investment, timeline and which suppliers have manufacturing plans in the country have not been disclosed.
Foxconn declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Apple and its key suppliers have been shifting production away from China, where strict COVID-19 curbs disrupted Foxconn's biggest iPhone factory last year. They are also seeking to avoid a potential hit to business from mounting Sino-U.S. trade friction.
Foxconn said on Wednesday it would ramp up investment outside China to meet customer demand and lower its reliance on China for production.
It was not immediately clear whether Foxconn's production plan would have impact on current AirPod suppliers, including Luxshare Precision Industry.
Luxshare did not immediately reply to a Reuters' request for comment.
Goertek Inc, another supplier, said in November an overseas client had asked it to suspend assembly work for a smart acoustic product, which analysts at the time identified as AirPods Pro 2, and the suspension would hit revenue by up to 3.3 billion yuan ($480 million).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837486,Why is the number of people identifying as 'Taiwanese' declining?,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — According a new study, the performance of Taiwan’s ruling political party explains why the number of people identifying as ‘Taiwanese' is declining.Data from National Chengchi University’s (NCCU) Election Study Center shows that in 1992, only about 17% of Taiwan’s people identified as “Taiwanese,"" the majority of people (46%) identified as both “Chinese and Taiwanese,"" and about 25% identified solely as “Chinese.""In 2020, over 64% of people identified solely as “Taiwanese,"" while about 30% identified as Taiwanese and Chinese, and only 3.6% as solely Chinese. This radical shift in Taiwan’s sense of self has typically been attributed to Taiwan’s democratization and growth of national pride, military threats from China solidifying Taiwanese national unity, and generational change, meaning fewer Taiwanese have familial or historical links to China.Despite this turnaround between 2014-2018 and 2020-2022, there was a reduction in the number of people identifying as “Taiwanese” and an increase in those identifying as “Chinese and Taiwanese.” Co-author and Assistant Professor Soochow University’s Department of Political Science Fang-Yu Chen and his co-authors' recent study is focused on finding out why.“Taiwanese identity is always the most salient issue in Taiwan’s party politics,"" according to Chen. Major political parties’ stance on cross-strait issues, such as Taiwan’s relationship with China, is the only area where they can show a meaningful difference in policy.(National Chengchi University Election Center image.)The study describes this as the “single political cleavage” driving voters’ preferences for Taiwan’s two major parties, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Kuomintang (KMT). “Within the DPP there is a spectrum, and on social issues, it is highly overlapping with the KMT,” Chen said.The study proposes that the DPP and KMT’s differing positions on cross-strait issues influence whether Taiwan’s people identify as “Taiwanese” or “Chinese and Taiwanese."" When the DPP performs well, the study links this to an increase in the number of those identifying solely as Taiwanese, because the party’s position on cross-strait relations is de facto independence.Conversely, when the KMT does well, there is an expected increase in those identifying as both Chinese and Taiwanese because the party aligns more closely with the “Republic of China in Taiwan."" The results are reversed when the parties’ performance is reversed.In 2016 the DPP gained control of the legislature and presidency for the first time in Taiwan, an event the study says framed the Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) presidency as the “realization of Taiwanese identity for voters.” It said that when Tsai’s government failed to perform, voters realized identifying as Taiwanese wasn’t lucrative, and became less likely to proclaim that identity.“The DPP did not perform well after fully controlling the government, and since Taiwanese identity is an issue owned by DPP, Taiwanese respondents switched from Taiwan identity to others as a hedging strategy,” the study said.Stamps commemorate Taiwan's first directly elected president, Lee Teng-hui (李登輝), elected in 1998. (CNA Photo)Though Taiwan’s former DPP President Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁)'s time in office (2000-2008) was marked by controversy, policy failures, and corruption, those identifying as Taiwanese did not decline during this time. The study pointed to the divided government as one reason which made it more difficult for voters to equate Chen’s performance with national identity.In addition, the percentage of those identifying as “Taiwanese” in the early 2000s was low but still growing across party lines. Post 2016, clear party-political alignments had emerged between those identifying as “Taiwanese,"" and those identifying as “Chinese and Taiwanese,"" with the DPP and the KMT respectively.Associate Teaching Professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia Dr. Sydney Yueh said that it is possible people identify in different ways depending on context. “Identity is usually announced or revealed when there is an external stimulant, such as a survey,” she said.“…NCCU’s election center conducts the survey annually, the answer about one’s identity is a political gesture or announcement,” Yueh said, adding that Chen’s paper is “definitely aligned with this assumption. They want to know people’s political identities, rather than other identities.Yueh gave the example of a DPP supporter with a clear Taiwanese identity and a parallel appreciation for Chinese literature. Chen agreed, saying that Taiwanese people might view identity differently for different purposes, and “some just take Taiwanese identity as an instrumental instead of a fundamental value.”President Tsai Ing-wen casts her ballot in a local election in 2022. (AP photo)According to NCCU’s data, 2020- 2022 shows a decline in the number of Taiwan’s people identifying as “Taiwanese.” Chen said that if the decline is statistically significant, they will replicate the study to see if the theory still applies.“My guess is that it does, as in this period the dissatisfaction on government responses to Covid-19 sharply increases,” Chen said.",2023/3/16,4386,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4837530,Disney changes Taiwanese character to Chinese in 'American Born Chinese',"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Disney+ has drawn criticism in Taiwan for changing a key character from Taiwanese to Chinese in the TV series ""American Born Chinese,"" prompting the creation of a petition calling for the character's Taiwanese nationality to be restored.In 2006, Gene Luen Yuan released the graphic novel ""American Born Chinese."" It soon garnered a number of awards, including the 2007 Michael L. Printz Award and was a New York Times bestseller.The book centers around a son of immigrants named Jin Wang and his struggles to adjust after moving from San Francisco's Chinatown to a new high school in the suburbs with only one other Asian student.The book is divided into three stories that tie together at the end, with the first story depicting Yang's version of the Monkey King character, Sun Wukong, in the Journey to the West. In the second story, Sun Wukong sends his son to be Jin's companion and learn how to interact with humans.The Monkey King's son takes the form of Wei-Chen Sun, a Taiwanese immigrant who has just arrived in the U.S., and becomes close friends with Jin. In the third story, Jin has transformed into a white boy named Danny and the Monkey King comes to earth and poses as Danny's cousin Chin-Kee, who is a racist stereotype of a Chinese person. Later in the story, the three characters reconcile and embrace their true identities.However, fans of the book recently discovered that the Disney+ TV adaptation of the series changed the origin of Wei-Chen from Taiwanese to Chinese. On Wednesday (March 15), a screenshot of the synopsis for Episode 1 on IMDB was shared on Reddit. The IMDB description states that Jin is ""assigned a new student 'shadow' from China named Wei-Chen Sun.""Synopsis of the series shows Wei-Chen originating from China. (IMDB screenshot)A 31-year-old man named Justin Lai (賴信義) posted a petition on Chang.org with the title: ""Stop Erasing Taiwanese in media - keep Wei-Chen's background in Taiwan."" Lai pointed out that although Taiwanese and Chinese people share some cultural and historical similarities, there are also substantial differences.He explained that ""Taiwan has its own government, military, and legal system, and many Taiwanese people view themselves as a separate and independent nation from China.""Amid China's increasingly aggressive actions against Taiwan, Lai argued that ""it is all the more inappropriate for a story which focuses on one's identity to remove the Taiwanese identity of Wei-Chen for political purposes."" Lai asserted that this not only compromises the story's message, but also denies representation for Taiwanese who ""struggle to see themselves in all forms of media.""He also referenced a memorable section of the book in which the teacher introduced Wei-Chen by saying that he and his family recently moved ""all the way from China!"" To which Wei-Chen said ""Taiwan,"" cueing the teacher to exclaim ""Taiwan!""The petition closes by arguing that it is time to stop deleting depictions of Taiwanese characters from popular media to ""satisfy the cravings of China, which is doing all it can to remove this identity and the livelihood of the people who have this identity.""Lai told Taiwan News that he moved to Taiwan in 2021 because he likes the country and wants to ""have a future here."" He said that although he is not Taiwanese, ""I am heavily into Taiwanese films/shows as well as Chinese mythology.""When he first heard about the show, he was initially very excited given the talent involved. However, he said that discovering the change in Wei-Chen's background was ""disappointing to say the least.""Based on the IMDB page for the show, the actor who plays Wei-Chen, Jim Liu (劉敬), is actually from Taiwan. He is a former Taekwondo champion from Taipei who turned to acting at age 17, before making his debut in 2020 as the lead actor in Limi Band’s music video “One of Two” (二分之一).Disney+ has yet to respond to a request for comment from Taiwan News.",2023/3/16,3727,Politics

The legislator said Chinese officials agreed to allow the soldier's family members to visit him and that she would accompany them on their trip.However, the legislator said that she was informed that the soldier does not want to return to Taiwan. She added that his family members have been notified that he is safe, but have not yet had direct communication with him.According to the legislator, the soldier's father is not from Kinmen and therefore cannot take the Little Three Links and will have to take the larger Three Links route instead. According to regulations, because the soldier has failed to return to his post for more than six days, he is now categorized as a deserter.The lawmaker was cited by Mirror Media as saying the soldier deserted his unit because he was ""under some personal pressure."" However, she emphasized that it was not caused by military discipline issues and called on young people to ""bear pressure bravely.""Chinese state-run media outlet Hong Kong China News Agency claimed the soldier has been ""eating well, sleeping well, and everything is fine.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838558,Taiwan's Acer confirms data breach,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Taiwanese technology company Acer confirmed earlier this week that company servers were hacked in February by a hacker using the name Kernelware.The hack was reported over a week ago, but Acer only confirmed this week that a server used by repair technicians was compromised. The company insists that no customer data was stolen in the security breach.According to a report from CPO magazine, Kernelware claims to have obtained 160 GB of data from 655 directories, constituting a total of 2,865 files. The threat actor shared screenshots of some files on a website called BreachForums, and requested a ransom payment in the cryptocurrency Monero.

While the breach may not compromise private customer information, the stolen files include sensitive information about how Acer devices and programs operate. If the files are released to malicious actors, it could create a host of cybersecurity problems and make Acer hardware throughout the world vulnerable to exploitation.Last week, a Swiss cybersecurity firm named Acronis was also targeted by Kernelware, according to a report from Computing. However, the Acronis hack only compromised about 12 GB of data.Acer previously suffered two major hacks in 2021. One was by a group called the REvil ransomware gang, which requested US$50 million (NT$1.53 billion) to protect sensitive financial documents. It is rumored the company paid the ransom price. A second breach happened on Acer systems located in India by a group called Desorden, reported Linux Experten.Some of the Acer data allegedly stolen in 2021 has since resurfaced and is now being auctioned off on hacker forums, as the company now deals with its most recent hack.Acer’s confirmation of its recent data breach comes on the heels of new regulations that were implemented in Taiwan earlier this month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838623,Taiwan’s Chelpis battles quantum computer attacks,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The next generation of technology, quantum computing, will execute tasks at great speed, defeating security features such as encryption and cryptography that form the backbone of blockchain systems like Bitcoin.To battle quantum computer attacks, security experts have scrambled to develop new data security tools and protocols. New terminology has also emerged, such as post-quantum cryptography (PQC), highlighting the danger all businesses, government agencies, and the public will face in the future.Rapid advancements in this field have given rise to new companies like Chelpis Co., which recently held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a 100-square meter office near Guting MRT Station. The move comes after the company raised NT$61 million (US$2 million) in an initial round of funding in April 2022.A large crowd was on hand to witness the event, including Openfind Chairman and I-Mei Foods CEO Luis Ko (高志明), former Taipei City Deputy Mayor Huang Shanshan (黃珊珊), and other leaders from both the technology sector and government.“I am delighted to provide support to young people involved in technology. I think that they can provide lots of new ideas and creativity. I also want to prevent hacking, and cyber security attacks, which will affect everyone,” said Ko.Later, Chelpis CEO Chih Ming-yang (池明洋) outlined the principles of the “zero trust” ecosystem, which has been widely accepted as the best protection against quantum computer attacks. Chih said that in the future, all participants in a zero trust network will need to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated.Advanced security measures will create a sort of secure information pipeline, or what Chelpis describes as “AORTA,” where endpoint users (EDGE users) on the periphery join the network through notebook computers or cell phones utilizing software encryption, and in the future, chip-enabled security.Chih said Chelpis is developing core software encryption technology useful to many business enterprises. He became interested in cryptography while studying for a master’s degree from National Taiwan University’s College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Many of the company's software team, including Chih, worked together in 2008 at the Cryptography Laboratory of National Taiwan University.End-to-end encryption is needed to prevent quantum computing attacks.

Lu said that many Taiwan companies have a need for post-quantum cryptography, especially those involved in financial services, manufacturing, and government agencies.Lu warned that security attacks can come from a variety of areas, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), surveillance technology, and automotive technology. With malicious attacks coming from so many sources, powerful computing chips are required for information security hardware in the next step.In the face of quantum computer attacks from all over the world, especially China, Lu said that Chelpis is keeping one step ahead of malicious cyber attacks with plans to integrate software and hardware to ensure data security.",2023/3/17,580,Business

The finance ministry said that in accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 10 of the ""special regulations on strengthening economic and social resilience after the pandemic and sharing economic results for all,"" it will distribute cash payments to the public to share in Taiwan's economic gains.The ministry said that, in principle, those who meet the eligibility requirements for disbursement before Oct. 31, can receive a cash payment of NT$6,000. The ministry said the four main groups eligible for the NT$6,000 bonus are as follows:In addition, to allow couples expecting children to share in the ""fruits of economic development,"" families of babies born before the end of this year will also be eligible to receive the tax surplus payment on behalf of their offspring.There are five methods planned to distribute the funds:Individuals who live in the remote townships of Shizi Township in Pingtung County, Wanrong Township in Hualien County, and Jinfeng Township in Taitung County can register for the rebates at their local police stations from March 20-25.On March 22, eligible members of the public can begin registering for the cash handouts on the finance ministry's 6,000 website https://6000.gov.tw. The ministry advised the public to exercise caution and avoid being deceived by fraudsters. In the event of suspected fraud, call the 165 anti-fraud hotline.In a press release Thursday, the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA), said that in order to avoid an overload of the website, registration over the first five days, March 22-26, will be limited by the last number of ID cards or residence permit numbers. On each of these days, registration will only be available to holders of ID or residence permits with one of two specific last digits and a lottery will be held on March 20 to determine these numbers.MODA said the registration system is expected to be online for at least six months. The ministry said that beyond the online registration system, the second phase of payments will be via ATMs and the third phase will be direct collection at the post office.In neither of these latter phases is registration on the system necessary, according to MODA. The ministry added that some groups of people, such as recipients of the Labor Insurance Pension, National Pension, Old Age Allowance, Labor Retirement, Disability Allowance, and Low and Middle Income Old Age Allowance, will be credited directly, and no registration is needed.MOF said the special budget has yet to be allocated, and thus the funds cannot yet be credited. It is estimated that the funds will be credited five business days after the budget is approved, and the president announces the date it goes into effect. When this announcement is made, the public can check whether the funds have been deposited in their bank accounts, passbooks, or on the 6,000 website.MODA then included detailed instructions on how to register with the 6,000 website. Once the initial registration is completed, the 6,000 website will present registration results beginning on March 28.The ministry also warned the public to not give their ID cards, residence permits, or health insurance cards to strangers. MODA said that it will send a notification of its NT$6,000 claim via text message or email and people should avoid clicking on any links not associated with the 6,000 website (https://6000.gov.tw).",2023/3/17,7741,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4838630,Scholar explains Taiwan's continued balancing act against China,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s balancing act against China is the best way forward, Dr. T.Y. Wang (王德育), a distinguished visiting scholar at National Chengchi University’s Election Study Center, said Tuesday (March 14).

            Balancing is “the posture and policy of a nation or group of nations protecting itself against another nation or group of nations by matching its power against the power of the other side,” according to Britannica.

            Wang told Taiwan News that balancing is the “optimal” tactic for Taiwan because it serves as a form of deterrence, though it requires the nation to “redistribute scarce resources on defense.” He said that President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) has been building up Taiwan’s military and deepening ties with the U.S. and Japan.

            Previous presidents were unable to form such close unofficial relationships with other countries, he said, but the international environment is more favorable for President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) to do so.











            Wang said Chinese nationalist sentiment is the driving force behind Beijing’s motivation to attack Taiwan, not the number of weapons or support Taiwan receives from the U.S. Another factor is Beijing's determination, he said.

            Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平) has shown that he wants to have a legacy and he has repeatedly stressed that the cross-strait dispute cannot be passed down from generation to generation, Wang said.

            “Xi wants to show that he was able to unify China. Taiwan is the last piece of the puzzle,” he said.

Strategic ambiguity still effective

            However, Taiwan has become part of the U.S. and its Western allies’ grand strategy of restricting China’s expansion, Wang said. In addition to strengthening partnerships such as QUAD and AUKUS, the U.S. is selling more advanced and mobile weapons to Taiwan and training Taiwanese troops in tactical maneuvering, he said.

            These actions are part of Washington’s efforts to prove to Beijing it will use force if a conflict erupts in the Taiwan Strait, Wang said. At the same time, Washington also needs “convincing assurances” to maintain an effective deterrence strategy, he said.

            One example of this is the U.S. refusal to support Taiwan independence. If Washington recognized Taiwan as a sovereign nation, “Beijing leaders are going to respond very violently,” Wang said.

            China would no longer have the incentive to comply with America’s demands. Thus, strategic ambiguity is still the best policy at the moment, he argued.

            Commenting on the state of cross-strait relations, Wang said there has been an “oscillation” in ties over many decades, referring to the ups and downs of the situation in the Taiwan Strait. During the height of the Cold War, relations between Taiwan and China were extremely tense, but by the 1970s, things became slightly better as China’s objective changed from liberating Taiwan to peaceful unification, he explained.

Cross-strait ties bind

            Ties between Taiwan and China all depend on “how Beijing leaders perceive the Taipei government,” Wang explained. “When they see Taipei taking a more independent approach, they tend to be more confrontational and tense, and put more pressure.”

            “A lot of those tense relationships were initiated by the Beijing government as a reaction towards Taipei’s policy,” he said. Beijing is essentially trying to create a new normal, which comes with frequent provocations, he added. “These can cause accidents, and they can escalate.”

            The professor described China as “very inflexible” when it comes to dialogue with Taiwan because it has boxed itself in with its ""one China policy."" “They cannot jump out of that principle.”

            He added the ball is now in China’s court and that it is “up to Beijing on how they want to play in the future.”

Lessons from Ukraine

            In terms of expanding Chinese authoritarianism, Wang said Beijing wants to portray its style of governance as an alternative to Western democracy. It uses examples such as the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack to paint democracy as a chaotic system, he said.

            China intends to restructure the international order but so far, there haven’t been any takers, he said. Nevertheless, it continues to gradually expand its sphere of influence, such as in Latin America.

            If a cross-strait conflict were to break out, Wang said he does not believe it will become World War III, as keeping it a local conflict is in the best interests of all involved parties.

            In the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. has tried to limit it to a regional war, he said. It is providing key security support but does not plan to have boots on the ground in order to prevent a conflict between two major powers.

            In the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. and China are all trying to avoid a war in the first place, Wang said.

            The war in Ukraine has also shown that “Taiwan needs to have the self-determination to defend itself,” he said. “The U.S. has no appetite to get involved directly in a cross-strait conflict.”

            Taiwan must find a way to maintain a sustainable defense to protect its own democracy, democratic way of life, and economic prosperity, Wang said. Ukrainians have shown that with a strong and determined defensive force, support from abroad will come, he said.

Taiwan must help itself

            Aside from bolstering its defense capabilities, Taiwan should also continue a pragmatic diplomacy of expanding its visibility on the international stage, Wang said, noting that Taiwan is handicapped by Beijing’s diplomatic isolation tactics.

            The professor also advised Taiwan to safeguard its democratic system, which is the most important weapon in the fight against authoritarianism. “If Taiwan is no longer a democracy, there is no reason for the U.S. to help Taiwan,” he said.

            Taiwan’s strategic importance also plays a major role in the U.S. and Western allies’ efforts to restrict China’s expansion, as it is located in the middle of the first island chain, he said. U.S. President Joe Biden has been able to internationalize the cross-strait conflict despite China’s claim that Taiwan affairs are an internal matter.

            Wang said he believes Taiwan’s situation is “certainly better” than before but whether that will continue “remains to be seen.” In the joint statements issued between the U.S. and Japan, South Korea, and other allies, they all voiced concerns about cross-strait tensions in recent years, Wang said, which shows that regional peace and stability are global concerns.

            Ultimately, Taiwanese “must help themselves first,” Wang said.

Keating claimed that the ""ball game has begun"" over the future of Taiwan, and alleged that the real aim of AUKUS is to serve Washington's ""underlying imperialism.""Keating, whose tenure as prime minister ended in 1996, described Taiwan as a ""territory that became a so-called 'democracy' as late as 1996."" In previous statements to the press club in 2021, Keating said that Taiwan is ""not a vital Australian interest,"" and he said that remains to be the case.He argued that an invasion of Tasmania would be a matter of vital interest to Australia. The ex-prime minister asserted that because Taiwan is a ""territory we have never recognized as a State,"" it is not worthy of such interest.Keating then dared current Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to ""explicitly suggest or leave open the question that Australia might go to war over Taiwan – at the urgings of the United States or anyone else.""On Friday (March 17), political scientist Wen-Ti Sung tweeted a screenshot of Keating's statements about Taiwan and stressed that although no democracy is perfect, the country is a ""solid multi-party liberal democracy that has undergone three peaceful transfers."" Sung noted that the 2022 Human Freedom Index (HFI), an index compiled by two think tanks, the U.S.-based Cato Institute, and Canada's Fraser Institute, rated Taiwan as the freest country in Asia .Sung also observed that The Economist Intelligence Business Unit (EIU) recently ranked Taiwan as the top ""fully democratic"" country in Asia and No. 8 in the world. This week, the human rights organization Civicus listed Taiwan as the only country in Asia with an open civic space for the fourth year in a row.The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continues to claim that Taiwan is part of China and constantly coerces world governments and international organizations to toe this line. However, Taiwan has never been part of the People's Republic of China. The country has its own military, currency, constitution, legal system, passport, flag, diplomatic allies, and democratically elected government.Wikipedia editors in May 2020 fiercely debated the merits of referring to Taiwan as a ""state"" or a ""country,"" and after a month of heated back and forth, a vote was cast. In a summary of the exchange posted on June 4, a numeric majority was reached with 33 editors voting in favor of ""country,"" 10 opting for ""state,"" and five others choosing a variant of ""state.""Former Australian PM Paul Keating wrote: ""Taiwan, a territory which became a so-called 'democracy' as late as 1996""

However, an MOL statement reminded employers to encourage workers to get vaccinated.The labor ministry said the suspension of isolation requirements for migrant workers is in line with a general relaxation of pandemic control policies, but reminded migrant workers to abide by epidemic prevention requirements when taking public transport and entering medical facilities.Migrant workers entering Taiwan before March 20 still need to isolate, but their employers can apply for a MOL subsidy of 50% of the accommodation costs.Wu Jing-ru (吳靜如), a researcher from the Taiwan International Workers Association (TIWA) told Taiwan News that while the change is positive, migrant workers still had to endure four additional months of entry restrictions that other groups did not. She said this shows the government will only listen to blue-collar migrant workers if they protest.“Whether this means government agencies and employers will stop using the pandemic as an excuse to trouble migrant workers, we'll just have to wait and see,” Wu said. “The government has taken the lead in this kind of discrimination for a long time, and that's why Taiwanese society is still very unfriendly to blue-collar migrant workers, no matter how many international conventions have been signed.”In February, migrant laborers and advocacy groups protested the restrictions saying they were discriminatory, citing the need for Alien Residence Certificate (ARC) holding migrant workers to apply for a re-entry permit. Other ARC holders did not have to do so.They also protested the high cost of the required isolation accommodation.

During the meeting, they were told different government agencies, the university, and the university president were still working to find a solution.Master’s student Jorge Salandia said that he still does not know if he will be able to finish his studies. “Basically, at this point, we are pushing for a little bit more clarity,” he said, “but we do realize this took MOFA by surprise, and of course our university, because I know it’s hard to ask them to take the burden.”Victor Hugo, also a master’s student, said despite the uncertainty, the group was highly appreciative of the government’s commitment to funding their studies until at least the end of the semester, and that this will give students, the university, and the government time to decide what to do. “Until June they will keep the stipend and the tuition coming, it will be enough time for them to prepare financially, and speak to any third party like their parents or the government in Honduras,” he said, “and there are three months for the universities to have a clear response.”Hugo also said that while the university had dealt with similar situations before, “they have only ever had one or two students in NCCU with this problem, but this time it was much more than that.”Taiwan News obtained a document showing that out of the 22 Hondurans enrolled at NCCU, 18 of them receive Taiwan government scholarships. Eight students receive funding from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), 10 from the Taiwan International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) scholarships, three are self-funded, and one receives an undefined scholarship.In Central America, students from Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize (of which the latter two are Taiwan's formal diplomatic allies) are currently eligible for the ICDF scholarship, though it is unclear whether Honduras will remain on this list. Before Panama broke ties with Taiwan in 2017 and Nicaragua did the same in 2021, ICDF was awarding scholarships to students from those countries, but no longer does.NCCU staff held a meeting on March 28 with its Honduran students for the first time since the Taiwan-Honduras diplomatic split was announced. (Taiwan News photo)Eligibility for the MOFA scholarship is not limited by nationality, though applications are administered by Taiwan’s diplomatic missions in applicants’ home countries. Taiwan’s embassy in Honduras has been disestablished with the ambassador returning to Taiwan on March 25.Abagail Duarte is an undergraduate student who is in her second semester with three more years of studies before graduation, and said that during their meeting the university and staff members had expressed remorse. “Even in the meeting they said ‘we are sorry’, and I was surprised, because we are the ones to be sorry,” she said.Hugo agreed, saying that during Taiwan’s relationship with Honduras, Taiwan never said “we can’t now.” “There was always an emergency committee, there were always missions sent to our country, and there were a bunch of sustainable projects in many parts of the country,” he said.Duarte also said that NCCU staff asked the Honduran students if they would consider going to China to complete their studies. She said that it was difficult to consider a move, because she and her peers had “already built a new life here” in Taiwan.Sophia Fuentes is also an undergraduate student with three more years of study before graduation, and said that for her, going to China is not an option she would consider. “One of the main reasons is that in going to China, we would need to start from zero, our credits will not be taken over,” she said.In addition to the disruption to study, Fuentes said that her government decisions appeared ungrateful to Taiwan, but that she and her classmates are “very thankful” to Taiwan for the support they have received. “It’s kind of unfair for Honduras to end relations so abruptly without even saying thank you,” she said, highlighting the more than 80 year relationship between the two countries.Duarte said that after the meeting with the university she realized it would take some time for the government and the university to decide what to do. “We realized that these decisions are not made in a week, it goes much deeper, and we just hope that the best decision will be made for us,” she said.Salandia agreed: “We just know it’s uncertain, but we are hoping for the best.”",2023/3/29,2308,Politics

Protecting freedom and democracy is a daily obligation, she told Taiwan News. This is why the Czech and Taiwanese parliaments have signed a statement on bilateral friendship.
It will serve as a platform to “deepen cooperation and share experiences and knowledge,” she said.
Though the 11 agreements the two countries have signed on this trip are related to different fields, they all help protect democracy and freedom, the speaker added.










Both the Senate President and Chamber of Deputies speaker have now visited Taiwan, and Adamova is sure her trip will not be the last.
During the height of the pandemic, when the Czech Republic needed masks, Taiwan was there to help, and later, the Czech Republic sent vaccines to Taiwan when it needed them most. According to Adamova, ""this is what friends and cooperation partners should do.”
Adamova vowed to promote mutual assistance between Taiwan and her country. “This is the primary goal I wanted to highlight in my speech at the Legislative Yuan,” she said.
“We are with you, as you are with us,"" Adamova conveyed.
The speaker said the delegation visited the Ministry of Digital Affairs and met with Minister of Digital Affairs Audrey Tang to share experiences in public security and cybersecurity. However, Adamova did not comment on whether the two nations were cooperating in national security and military areas.

Tsai has been an important U.S. partner during her two terms and her possible successor, Lai Ching-te (賴清德) would likely follow suit, Hammond-Chambers said. Lai would also maintain good ties with Japan, he added.
“The foreign policy and national security officials that have been indispensable to President Tsai’s government are likely to retire, opening the door for a new stable of leadership,” Hammond-Chambers said.
Under Ma, Taiwan pursued closer relations with China, which led to a U.S. arms sales freeze from 2011 to 2015 that “contributed mightily to the current military power imbalance in the Taiwan Strait,” the council president said.










While there are many “superb” senior KMT party members who would advocate for continued amicable U.S.-Japan relations, the old party leadership, including Ma, will seek to resume cross-strait exchanges, “possibly at the expense of America and its allies,” Hammond-Chambers said. Taiwan could possibly drift away from the U.S. under a KMT president, which would draw heavy criticism from the U.S. Congress and various government departments “insisting that Taiwan is the problem,” he said.
China could then capitalize on this rift in U.S.-Taiwan relations, which would damage peace and security in the Taiwan Strait, he noted. Ultimately, “Who runs Taiwan and what policies they will pursue have real implications for American national interests,” he said.

On Monday (March 27), Yvonne Murray, a journalist with the Irish Times, asked about the topic after mentioning that Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) will visit the U.S. this week.When asked by Murray if the UN leader has any message for Tsai, the president of “what’s considered Asia’s leading democracy,” Dujarric said that his position on the matter is “guided by the General Assembly’s resolution on the One China policy.”“Sorry. I’m not asking about China. I’m asking about Taiwan,” Murray said. She then went on to ask why Taiwanese people are not allowed to enter UN buildings for tours or meetings.Dujarric explained that only individuals with an ID issued by a member state of the UN may enter. However, the spokesperson was unprepared when Al Jazeera reporter James Bays followed up by asking if the decision to exclude Taiwanese people was based on a decision by the General Assembly or one by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.Dujarric was not sure about the answer. Bays then pressed Dujarric further by saying, “It seems to me all of these people are citizens of the world. And I wouldn’t have thought that the secretary-general is someone who wants to practice discrimination.”Later during Monday’s press conference, a French reporter, Celhia De Lavarene, returned to the issue of Taiwanese visitors being excluded from UN buildings. “I want to know, is China running the UN?” Lavarene asked bluntly.Dujarric said Lavarene’s question was the most “ridiculous” he had heard that day. The Spokesperson for the General-Secretary then concluded his talk with the press.On Tuesday (March 28), Dujarric was again asked about the issue by journalist Joe Klein during a daily briefing. Klein said he examined General Assembly resolution 2758, which expelled Chiang Kai-shek and his representatives from the UN body, but “there’s no reference to excluding the Taiwanese people from participation in UN activities.”

Dujarric, who was flustered in his reply, contested Klein’s use of the word “exclude,” but was unable to explain the origin and legal justification for the UN’s policy of not allowing Taiwanese people to enter UN buildings or join UN activities.“I will get back to you as soon as I have the answer,” said Dujarric, before hastily moving on to another question.",2023/3/29,3507,Politics

Kuomintang legislator Chan Wei-yuan (詹為元) said on Facebook on Monday (March 27) that Chiang’s intentions are good but will not solve the problems caused by a lack of public bikes in the city.“Among the top five problems reported by the public, ‘no bikes to borrow’ ranked first,” Chan said, “however the statistics can’t reflect the reality of the situation, because most people go to the rental point, find that there are no bikes, and leave.” He said that because people often do not report the lack of bikes, the statistics are likely inaccurate.“If the 30 minutes of the bike rental are free, it’s likely to be more difficult for people to borrow bikes during peak periods,” Chan said. “The only thing to say is that the current strategy of dispatching staff with extra bikes is too slow,” he added.Longshan Temple and Taipei 101 MRT stations’ Youbike docks are reported to be the most difficult to secure a bike at peak times, with wait times of up to 20 minutes. “Reports of bikes being unavailable at Exit 2 of Taipei 101/World Trade Center Station in my constituency are as high as 69 times,” Chan said.Despite the criticism, cheaper Youbike rides may prove popular among constituents, following the announcement that taxi fares in the greater Taipei area will be raised on Saturday (April 1). Local authorities said the base fare for the first 1.25 kilometers will increase from NT$70 (US$2.30) to NT$85, after which the mileage rate will remain at NT$5 per 200 meters, and waiting fees will be increased.Bringing back free Youbike rides is not the only policy affecting public spaces that Chiang wants to resurrect, with UDN reporting in February that he and his deputy Lee Shu-chuan (李四川) intended to bring back many of the city’s rubbish bins removed under former Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲).",2023/3/29,642,Society

On Tuesday (March 28), the second day of his trip, he visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, China.While speaking to the media outside the mausoleum, Ma said that ""People on both sides are ethnic Chinese and are descendants of the Yan and Huang emperors."" He also called on the two sides of the strait to ""pursue peace, avoid war, and dedicate themselves to reinvigorating the Chinese spirit,"" which is the responsibility of ""Chinese people on the two sides.""However, recent polls show that citizens of Taiwan consider themselves Taiwanese, while the percentage who identify exclusively as Chinese is in the single digits.Peaking in popularity at the start of Ma's trip was the story of a baboon that had been on the loose in Taoyuan City for 16 days. On Monday (March 27), it was captured but soon died after it was shot in the chest by a hunter.The hunter is facing criminal charges of violating the Wildlife Conservation Act (野生動物保育法), while Taoyuan Department of Agriculture officials also face scrutiny for their handling of the incident.

Out of fear that Taiwan’s current existence may end, Wang called for cooperation with Beijing so that Taiwan can maintain its political system and avoid war.
Wang, who served as President of the Control Yuan from 2008 to 2014, is currently 84 years old. He was a founding member of the New Party, formerly the New Chinese Party, which advocates for unification with communist China.
At Wednesday's event, Wang revealed new business cards which feature a cartoonish picture of himself as a pig, which he jokingly explained is a reference to the insult of “foreign pig (外省豬),” which has been used to insult those who arrived from China in 1949. Wang claims to hear this insult often when he discusses the political unification of Taiwan with China.
“Even foreign pigs love Taiwan,” Wang said, “We have contributed a lot to Taiwan. If there is a war, I will definitely stay in Taiwan.""
Wang, a former member of the Kuomintang, once ran for Taipei mayor in 1998 as a third party candidate against the KMT’s Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) and the DPP’s Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁). In that race, he came in a distant third place with under 3% of the vote.
A decade later, in 2008, during the first year of the Ma administration, Ma appointed Wang to manage the Control Yuan. The Control Yuan is the supervisory organ of the government, tasked with auditing the other four branches.
As a Taiwanese politician with a favorable view of the Chinese Communist Party, Wang is unlikely to receive more than one or two percentage points of any national vote. His candidacy will likely serve as an annoyance to the KMT candidate, since he may draw votes away from the fringes of the pan-blue camp.

He said at the time, he and his developers were lucky to find a middle ground between some of the major companies in the photo collage app market, and the new entrants with little experience.“We were in between,” Fan joked, “we weren’t too professional, and our app didn't crash.” He said the simple and casual appearance of the app also allowed it to flourish in non-English speaking markets, without needing to be translated.Fan added that releasing updates for the app every week made him realize that he had found an app that people wanted. He said that for an app developer, being too busy with updates to ask what to do next means you have already found the answer to that question.Fan attributes part of his company’s success to having an international and gender-diverse team. He also said that many of Taipei’s “little details” such as safety and convenience of transport made it easy to recruit people from overseas, saying that about one third of the Taipei team have moved from other countries to work here.“The environment in Taiwan is supportive for building creative things,” Fan said, adding that this is underappreciated internationally.He said when people think of Taiwan, most think of companies like TSMC who work in the background engineering hardware, but that a benefit of working in Taiwan is that his company has “been able to find people who could work for TSMC but are excited to work in a creative environment.”",2023/3/18,1173,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4840210,US attempting to deter Honduras from severing ties with Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. is trying to dissuade Honduras from switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, Reuters cited sources familiar with the matter as saying.
President of Honduras, Xiaomara Castro, on Tuesday (March 14) revealed in a tweet that she had instructed Honduras Foreign Minister Eduardo Reina to oversee the process of forming official ties with Beijing. She justified her decision as being “a sign of my determination to fulfill the government plan and expand borders.”
However, she has yet to officially recognize Beijing, leaving bilateral ties with Taiwan in an awkward state of limbo.
""We truly don't know whether it will be days or weeks or months,"" Reuters quoted a U.S. government official as saying. ""Is it a negotiating tactic? We don't know for sure, but we will continue to make our case.""










John Feeley, who was U.S. ambassador to Panama, said he received “an hour heads up,"" even after he had talked to the president when the nation switched recognition to Beijing in 2017.
The U.S. may choose to cut aid to the Central American country if it follows through on its decision to sever ties with Taiwan, which is authorized by the 2020 Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative Act. The act gives the Department of State the authority to expand, reduce, or terminate U.S. aid to countries depending on whether they improve, worsen, or sever diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
Castro had pledged to recognize Beijing during her presidential campaign but seemingly backtracked once she took office.
Chinese Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Xie Feng (謝峰) met with Reina in January when the two both attended Brazilian President Lula da Silva’s inauguration. The two ministers reportedly discussed potential cooperation on the Patuca II hydropower project in Honduras.
However, Reina later stressed that the conversation with Xie ""was a purely commercial issue, we maintain the relationship with Taiwan.”
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Tah-ray Yui (俞大㵢) met with Honduran Ambassador to Taiwan Harold Burgos on Wednesday morning (March 15), expressing serious concern over Honduras President Xiomara Castro's decision to establish diplomatic ties with China, per a Ministry of Foreign Affairs press release.
Yui reiterated that Taiwan and Honduras have been friends for more than 80 years. Over the years, Taiwan has promoted many cooperation projects with the Honduran government to benefit the people of the two countries, he said.
""Taiwan is a sincere and reliable ally of Honduras,"" he said.
""The government and people of Taiwan have always assisted in Honduras' development and construction within the scope of their capabilities and have lent a helping hand when it was most needed,"" Yui added, which is in contrast to the ""flashy promises"" made by the Chinese dictatorship.
Beijing intends to wrest control of Taiwan's diplomatic relations and reduce Taiwan's international space, the vice minister said. He reminded Honduras to carefully consider its decision and not to ""fall into China's trap"" by damaging the long-term friendship between Taiwan and Honduras.
Reina later explained to Honduras’ Canal 5 television channel that the Honduran government had requested Taiwan to double its annual US$50 million in aid and consider ""realigning"" its US$600 million debt, but did not receive positive responses, AFP reported.
He said that Honduras has energy needs and growing debt, which is ""drowning the country.""
If Honduras ends up officially establishing ties with China, Taiwan will have 13 remaining diplomatic allies.

For the next 16 days until the animal was shot by a hunter on March 27, the theme park continued to deny that the creature had escaped from its property.Adding to the controversy were claims by the hunter surnamed Lin (林) that he had been authorized by a Leofoo Village employee to shoot the baboon when it rushed toward him. Leofoo Village is currently disputing this claim.On Wednesday evening (March 29), Leofoo Village released a statement in which it claimed that because the containment measures around the baboon area seemed to be normal when the baboon was spotted in Taoyuan City, the park did not believe that any of its baboons had escaped. However, it was revealed that when a veterinarian assisted in capturing the baboon, its tubal ligation scars were consistent with those of the baboons in the park, and it was determined that the escaped primate belonged to Leofoo Village.It also issued the following apology:""We feel infinitely saddened by the passing of the baboon's life. We are deeply sorry for causing trouble for the public and expending social resources. The park has conducted a self-reflection. Relevant supervisors and colleagues will be punished, and the company will share the responsibility with the employees.""After the statement was released, netizens flooded Leofoo Village's Facebook page to criticize the company for its actions. Many questioned the sincerity of the management's apology and condemned their handling of the escape.Netizens accused Leofoo Village of being ""full of lies and excuses."" Many expressed a wish to boycott the park, but worried about the livelihood of the animals in the park.They suggested that if Leofoo Village had admitted the escape from the beginning, the baboon may not have been hunted down in the same manner.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851000,Taiwan’s falling birth rate due to marriage hesitancy,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — For the past 20 years, Taiwan has faced a declining birth rate and the problem is only getting worse.
Last year, the number of newborns was just 138,000, and the fertility rate dropped to 0.87, both historical lows. This trend threatens economic growth and social stability.
At a press conference on Thursday (March 30) hosted by Business Today, stakeholders addressed the underlying causes of this issue, such as marriage hesitancy, economic concerns, lack of partners, and a lack of government support.
“A super aged society paired together with a low birth rate is a very big problem for society. We need to find solutions quickly through new research. Our birth rate has even fallen behind that of Europe and Japan. This makes me wonder why we can not be more successful in raising the birth rate, said Business Today President Liang Yung-huang (梁永煌).










Liang attributes Taiwan’s low birth rate to the economic pressure felt by young people. He believes the government has adopted the wrong attitude to the situation which is only bound to get worse.
“There’s no hope for Taiwan if we don’t solve this problem, and we hope that today we can have a new beginning and a better concept of this problem,” said Liang.
Later in the press conference, findings of a survey carried out by the publication in conjunction with Pollster were presented. The fertility rate of married women has actually grown since 2003, but the number of unmarried women has expanded year by year. According to statistics in 2021, the unmarried rate of Taiwan's marriageable population aged 25 to 34 reached 49.36%.
Furthermore, poll results showed that 56.2% of all unmarried people have the intention of getting married, with 69.58% of men wanting to get married, which is much higher than 45.91% of women. The lack of a partner as well as economic conditions are two major obstacles to marriage.
As for what the government can do to promote more marriages, some suggestions offered by survey participants include the creation of a marriage fund as well as housing subsidies for newlyweds. A few have even asked for straightforward benefits such as tax breaks.
Willingness to have children
Business Today found that among unmarried people, 61.22% of men want to have children, much higher than 42.98% of women. The greatest obstacle to raising children is money, as 70% of the survey respondents say they are afraid that they will not be able to support them.
In terms of age, people’s willingness to have children decreased with age, but even among unmarried people aged 40 to 49, 46.11% still expressed a desire to have children.
In recent years, in order to encourage more childbirths, central and local governments have successively introduced policies such as childcare allowances, childcare subsidies, parental leave, and other cash subsidies.
The survey found that less than 30% of respondents would be encouraged to have children because of these policies.
As for what measures the public believes would be the most helpful to increase their willingness to have children, the survey found three effective measures: a monthly subsidy for all children under the age of 18, 30 days of parental leave every year, along with flexible work schedules, and better quality public daycare services.
Building a good foundation
While financial stimulus plans can encourage young people to have children, researchers are finding that many young people are having tremendous difficulty getting to the stage in life where having children is something they would consider.
One obstacle is that many young people regard buying an apartment or a house as a prerequisite for marriage. In the survey, Business Today found that 43.4% of people had considered delaying marriage or not getting married because of plans to buy a house.
The results of Business Today’s survey about marriage and child rearing show that government incentives are currently insufficient. The glimmer of hope is that more than half of unmarried people do have the desire to have children. This indicates that the government should also make concerted efforts to remove obstacles to marriage.
Only after promoting marriage can Taiwan begin to rescue the problem of a declining birth rate, which will require more comprehensive support for young families with better childbearing policies that can carry on the hope of more future generations to come.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — For the past 20 years, Taiwan has faced a declining birth rate and the problem is only getting worse.Last year, the number of newborns was just 138,000, and the fertility rate dropped to 0.87, both historical lows.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851156,Whistleblower says Taiwan courting Ghana as possible ally,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taipei is courting the African nation of Ghana to establish diplomatic relations, according to an anonymous whistleblower with alleged connections to Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).UDN reported on Thursday (March 30) that MOFA dispatched Chang Chun-yu (張均宇) to serve as director of the Taipei Trade Office in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2022, with the additional directive of establishing contact with government officials in Ghana. According to the UDN source, Taipei hoped to establish ties with Ghana prior to severing ties with Honduras, which had been anticipated.

Chang was ostensibly sent to Lagos to take over for envoy Liu Yi-ping (劉翼平) in early 2022. However, Chang and Liu continued to serve in the same ministerial position in Lagos for over a year.The whistleblower asked why MOFA would station two high-level ministers at a trade office for so long. They suggested that there was other diplomatic work being done in the region, outside of Nigeria.The most extraordinary claim of the whistleblower is that MOFA allegedly paid a Taiwanese business executive, surnamed Huang (黃), to act as a broker with the Ghanaian government. The anonymous source claims that Taiwan paid a fee of US$20 million (NT$610 million) to start talks about establishing diplomatic relations with Accra, but that nothing has yet come from the expenditure.In response to the UDN report, MOFA called the claims completely fictitious. It accused the whistleblower of starting malicious rumors that would be echoed by pro-China media to defame Taiwan. MOFA said the details of the report do not match the facts, and condemned the allegations.Ghana has experienced some diplomatic friction with China over the years and is reportedly seeking international aid in settling or restructuring Accra’s debts to Beijing. Some recent reports suggest that there is public dissatisfaction among the Ghanaian public with regard to China’s economic activity in the region, and its exploitation of Ghana’s natural resources.This week, U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris visited Ghana, where she met with political leaders and pledged security and economic assistance to Ghana and Central Africa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4851158,President Tsai highlights Taiwan's progress at welcome banquet,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) praised the progress Taiwan has made in the post-pandemic era at a welcome banquet in New York City on Wednesday (March 29).
Speaking to the local Taiwanese community, Tsai said Taiwan has changed in three important ways, CNA reported.
The first change is that Taiwan has become more resilient one step at a time, Tsai said. The government has increased tax revenue and invested in many policies and construction projects, while social welfare, childcare, and elderly care have been carried out diligently.
Special budgets have been set up to help small and medium sized businesses and disadvantaged groups. Through tough times, the nation is moving toward economic recovery, she said.










Taiwan's military and national defense have also been strengthened, Tsai added.
The second change is the increased global attention Taiwan is getting, the president pointed out. In the past three years, the nation’s pandemic prevention measures have received praise from the world.
In times of difficulty, many countries helped Taiwan, demonstrating that democratic partners work together to create a “cycle of goodness,” she said.
The third change is Taiwan’s significant strides in diplomacy and its deepening ties with the U.S., Tsai said. Over the past three years, Taipei and Washington have made major progress in bilateral exchanges, trade, and security.
Taiwan does not provoke or give in to international pressure, the president said. “Taiwan demonstrates its will and determination to defend itself, and demonstrates composure, calmness, and risk control.”
Tsai added that Taiwan is at the forefront of the world's democratic front. The more united the Taiwanese, the safer the world will be.
She vowed that Taiwan would continue to walk on the path of freedom and democracy.
American Institute in Taiwan Chair Laura Rosenberger also delivered remarks, saying that the U.S. is working hard to establish a global partnership that includes Taiwan. This includes providing assistance programs to Taiwan’s partners, allowing Taiwan to meaningfully participate in international organizations and multilateral forums, and working closely with like-minded partners to help them know more about Taiwan.

After a layover in New York, Tsai will head to Belize and Guatemala, Taiwan’s sole Central American allies, to solidify relations.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) praised the progress Taiwan has made in the post-pandemic era at a welcome banquet in New York City on Wednesday (March 29).Speaking to the local Taiwanese community, Tsai said Taiwan has changed in three important ways, CNA reported.The first change is that Taiwan has become more resilient one step at a time, Tsai said. The government has increased tax revenue and invested in many policies and construction projects, while social welfare, childcare, and elderly care have been carried out diligently.Special budgets have been set up to help small and medium sized businesses and disadvantaged groups. Through tough times, the nation is moving toward economic recovery, she said.Taiwan's military and national defense have also been strengthened, Tsai added.The second change is the increased global attention Taiwan is getting, the president pointed out. In the past three years, the nation’s pandemic prevention measures have received praise from the world.In times of difficulty, many countries helped Taiwan, demonstrating that democratic partners work together to create a “cycle of goodness,” she said.The third change is Taiwan’s significant strides in diplomacy and its deepening ties with the U.S., Tsai said. Over the past three years, Taipei and Washington have made major progress in bilateral exchanges, trade, and security.Taiwan does not provoke or give in to international pressure, the president said. “Taiwan demonstrates its will and determination to defend itself, and demonstrates composure, calmness, and risk control.”Tsai added that Taiwan is at the forefront of the world's democratic front. The more united the Taiwanese, the safer the world will be.She vowed that Taiwan would continue to walk on the path of freedom and democracy.American Institute in Taiwan Chair Laura Rosenberger also delivered remarks, saying that the U.S. is working hard to establish a global partnership that includes Taiwan. This includes providing assistance programs to Taiwan’s partners, allowing Taiwan to meaningfully participate in international organizations and multilateral forums, and working closely with like-minded partners to help them know more about Taiwan.Rosenberg said that maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is the core of America’s regional policy. It is not only crucial to regional security and prosperity, but also to global security and prosperity.She thanked Tsai for her commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity.After a layover in New York, Tsai will head to Belize and Guatemala, Taiwan’s sole Central American allies, to solidify relations.",2023/3/30,1252,Politics

When he came upon an exhibit titled ""Taiwan Compatriots Assisting Epidemic Prevention Zone,"" the guide claimed that some Taiwanese in Wuhan at the start of the outbreak were stranded because they had been traveling as tourists and wanted to leave Hubei and Wuhan as soon as possible.After the first batch of Taiwanese returned to their hometowns, the guide alleged that the Chinese government originally planned to send the rest of the ""Taiwanese compatriots"" back to Taiwan on Feb. 5 and 6. However, the guide purported that the remaining flights were ""blocked by Democratic Progressive Party authorities, making it difficult for Taiwanese stranded in Wuhan to return home.""The guide claimed that it was only after continuous efforts by the Chinese government that all Taiwanese were sent back to their hometowns by April 21. After listening to the guide's story, Ma turned to Zhang Dingyu (張定宇), the head of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, which was one of the first hospitals to deal with the disease, and said, ""I'm sorry that our government has caused you trouble.""In addition, Ma said that under the leadership of Zhang, the epidemic was initially controlled to prevent it from expanding significantly. ""We admire this very much. This was not just for Mainland China, but rather was a contribution to humanity as a whole,"" Ma said.When asked to comment on Ma's remarks in Wuhan during a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Wang said ""From his own (Ma's) perspective as a Chinese, since it is a Chinese point of view, we respect him."" However, regarding China's alleged contributions, he bluntly said, ""What exactly was their contribution? This pandemic started in Wuhan, China, and spread to the whole world, causing 700 million people to be infected and more than seven million people to die. Of course, we know that the number is greatly underestimated.""Wang went on to say, ""I don't understand what contribution (was made), but what I do know is that this was a catastrophe for humanity.""Regarding potential future exchanges with counterparts in China, Wang said that future medical and health exchanges and professional exchanges between the two sides of the strait are very much anticipated and welcome. Wang then asked, ""But is it not possible to start by replying to our emails?""Wang added that it would be ""very kind and polite"" if his Chinese counterparts would respond to the CECC's emails. He closed by saying that if there is reciprocity in terms of email communication, ""we will move forward step by step from there.""",2023/3/30,1587,Politics

They even asked us where we were at the moment,” Huang wrote.He added that as the train approached Huzhou Station, it finally slowed down. “It seemed that the control center finally intervened and started operating it. However, perhaps because they were too slow or there was an issue with manual operation, when the train stopped it was past the platform…,"" Huang explained.According to Huang, when the train’s doors finally opened again, it was at Dahu Park Station.Huang questioned that, considering the high frequency of trains on the Wenhu Line during rush hour, if a fellow passenger train had not alerted the control center staff about the incident, “Would the control center only realize what was going on only after we hit the previous train?”In response to the incident and Huang’s concern, Metro Taipei wrote in a press release that all trains on the Wenhu Line are equipped with automatic train protection (ATP) technology, which ensures a safe distance between each train. At the time of the incident, the train’s ATP had been functional, it added.The company apologized for the malfunction and vowed to investigate.

Meaning “wind power generation,” the simplified characters ""风力发电"" appeared on the cover of the pamphlet, which appear as ""風力發電"" in traditional Chinese characters.DPP legislator Cho Kuan-ting (卓冠廷) slammed the New Taipei City government for the blunder and said this was proof it could not protect Taiwan. ""If you can't even protect the traditional characters of the Republic of China, how can you possibly be able to protect the Republic of China and Taiwan,"" he said.The DPP legislators alleged that the textbooks were ordered from the Chinese online retail giant Taobao, but the city government denied this and said they were manufactured in Tainan. The city government said that training will be put in place for city employees to ensure the mistake is not repeated.The educational product's instruction pamphlet is shown with simplified characters appearing throughout. (Facebook, Cho Kuan-ting photo)They also denied the legislators’ accusation that NT$5.1 million (US$170,000) had been spent on the pamphlets, and issued a statement saying only NT$9,975 was spent. The spokesperson for the environmental protection wing of the city government, Hsu Ming-chih (許銘志), warned that these accusations are not in the public interest.This is the second time simplified characters have caused political controversy in recent weeks, with independent legislator May Chin (高金素梅) receiving criticism for using briefing notes written in simplified characters during a parliamentary debate on March 15. In 2019, simplified characters were discovered on road markings in Kaohsiung, and were subsequently re-written using traditional characters.Taiwan, Hong Kong, and many overseas Chinese communities use traditional Chinese characters, while China, Malaysia, and Singapore use simplified characters. A small number of simplified characters appear in informal settings in Taiwan, though it is generally regarded as unacceptable to use simplified characters for formal communications.",2023/3/30,2336,Politics

The group comprises 63 people from 16 families, including 35 children.The group has remained in Thailand for nearly a year, despite the Chinese state security apparatus threatening their safety on a daily basis, according to ChinaAid.

U.S. President Donald Trump greenlit the sale of the Javelin missiles and TOW 2B RF missiles to Taiwan in 2019, CNA cited Su as saying. The Javelin missile is a ‘fire-and-forget’ weapon that can pierce armor 800 mm thick and autonomously guide itself to the target, he said.
Su added that the missile can explode from above a target, enabling greater lethality. The missile is most effective in preventing an amphibious landing, he said.










The military’s choice of weapons reveals its “innovative thinking,” the director said. He pointed out that the army is considering using a large number of anti-armor missiles as near-shore weapons to create a strategic advantage.
A battalion-sized landing force needs about 25 to 30 landing craft to seize a beach, Su said. These uncovered landing craft and lightly armored amphibious vehicles will just be targets for the Javelin missile.

Taipei filed its membership application in Sept. 2021, less than a week after China, causing concern that Beijing might try to interfere and block Taiwan’s access.The fact that an advanced economy like the U.K. needed a rigorous review process lasting two years before being accepted, should be a positive sign for Taiwan, according to Yen Huai-shing (顏慧欣), senior deputy executive director of the Taiwan World Trade Organization (WTO) and RTA Center at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER).She said that as Taiwan’s contributions to stable supply chains and to the semiconductor sector were significant, there was a strong chance that the country would be allowed to join ahead of China. Yen added that Taiwan’s promises of legislation and execution were consistent, inspiring reliability, CNA reported.In contrast to Taiwan, China’s actions after joining the WTO were somewhat different from its promises, causing some credibility problems, Yen said.

Second, regional cooperation is divided into three areas, including how countries respond to climate change, international health issues, and fake news, he said.
Third, all countries and regions must be connected at multiple levels to achieve prosperity, Horii added.










Fourth, in terms of security, Japan will pay more attention to airspace issues, rather than focusing solely on maritime security. In this regard, Japan must strengthen international cooperation in regional security.
This strategy has been endorsed by many countries, including Taiwan, the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, and ASEAN countries, Liberty Times cited the politician as saying. The international community must cooperate to safeguard peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, East China Sea, East Asia, and the Indo-Pacific, he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842510,'Naive leftists' or rational peace seekers? Taiwan scholars release anti-war statement,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A group of Taiwanese anti-war scholars have called for Taiwan to maintain “equidistant relationships” between China and the U.S. while issuing a list of four demands including redirecting Taiwan’s military budget to climate change mitigation and social welfare.The Taiwan Anti-war Statement Working Group held a press conference on Monday (March 20) to present a list of 37 Taiwanese scholars' demands calling for “peace, anti-armament, independence, and climate action,” per CNA. The press conference was chaired by retired National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Professor Daiwei Fu (傅大為), who said that China’s constant threats to Taiwan mostly originate from U.S. provocations.The group called for an end to the Ukraine war, an end to U.S. militarism and economic sanctions, prevention of war between China and the U.S., and directing spending to social welfare and climate mitigation instead of military buildup.Academia Sinica researcher Lu Chien-yi (盧倩儀) said that U.S. militarism has led to the country's massive social welfare deficiencies, crumbling infrastructure, and decline in life expectancy. “Taiwanese politicians continue to imitate the U.S. in reducing social welfare and climate budgets, why are we still foolishly singing their praises?” Lu asked.Lu said that the U.S. insistence on maintaining global hegemony has sacrificed many countries, and warned that Taiwan may be next. She said that China was not the only threat Taiwan faced and that military threats should be considered rationally.Lu also questioned the U.S. commitment to Taiwan, pointing out that the life expectancy of an average U.S. citizen is less than China’s due to the prioritization of military spending gutting social welfare programs, per Watchout. “The United States doesn't even care about the lives of Americans, will it really care about Taiwanese people?"" she asked.Retired NCCU College of Communications Professor Kuo Li-hsin (郭力昕) said he hoped the call would initiate a more thoughtful discussion in Taiwanese society around military threats. ""In a society that prides itself on democracy and freedom of speech, we hope there can be more deep thought and dialogue,"" he said.The group’s statement was met with harsh criticism from Assistant Professor at Soochow University’s Department of Political Science Fang-Yu Chen (陳方隅), who described them as ""naive leftists,"" per Watchout. Chen (who recently co-authored a study probing the declining number of people identifying as “Taiwanese” said that the group’s “anti-American imperialism” standpoint meant their views would highly overlap with those supporters of China-Taiwan unification, even if the group itself did not support this.Chen said he agrees with the idea of “anti-war,” but said that the initiative to achieve this should be taken by China. He said that U.S. policy is to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, which is in line with Taiwan’s aim of “maintaining independence and self-reliance.”Jo-shui Chen (陳弱水), former Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at National Taiwan University and Tang and Song Dynasty scholar, said that talking about “anti-war” is the same as talking about surrender. Chen said that China’s military spending is more than 11 times that of Taiwan’s, and “if Taiwan leaves the United States and its democratic allies in order to pursue ‘equivalence,’ it will be in a desperate situation.”Fu said that a version of the statement had been leaked on the internet before it was announced officially, and that it was already blacklisted before there was a chance for a fair discussion. The critics “have already stolen a lot of ground,"" he said.The group’s controversial “anti-war” statement comes as calls to demilitarize the island territories of Matsu and Kinmen grow, a move Chen told Taiwan News would change little. “In my opinion, Kinmen and Matsu have already demilitarized because we have very few military personnel there,” he said.Chen said that it makes no difference if Taiwan has 100 troops stationed on Matsu or none, saying “we cannot defend for even one day,” and that demilitarizing would be purely symbolic. “The question is whether we want to send this signal, because it is a very big signal,"" he said.",2023/3/21,2067,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842912,Qualcomm speeds shift of chip production from China to Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — U.S. smartphone chip designer Qualcomm is accelerating the movement of its supply out of China in favor of Taiwan, with plans to boost its purchases in the island country to NT$300 million (US$9.83 million) in 2024.In response to the increased geopolitical risks incurred by the U.S.-China chip war, mobile phone chip manufacturer Qualcomm has accelerated the transfer of chip production supply chains out of China. Orders that had previously been entrusted to Chinese wafer foundries or packaging and testing factories are steadily being transferred to firms in Taiwan.Mass production of chips for Qualcomm in Taiwan will start after certifications are completed in the second quarter, and Taiwanese suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC), United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), Chunghwa Precision Test (CHPT), Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. (ASE Group), Sporton International Inc., and Unimicron will benefit directly, reported Commercial Times.Qualcomm held an opening ceremony for a manufacturing engineering and testing center in Hsinchu on Friday (March 17), demonstrating that Taiwan is a top player in advanced manufacturing processes and semiconductor testing. Qualcomm has plans to accelerate its sourcing in Taiwan to NT$300 billion in 2024.According to industry analysts, the demand for smartphones is weak, but Qualcomm has expanded its production scale in Taiwan. In addition to Qualcomm's success in non-consumer fields such as automotive electronics and industrial automation in recent years, the key reason for moving to Taiwan is that the US-China chip war has prompted Qualcomm to shift production away from China amid heightened geopolitical risks.Based on information released by Qualcomm, its front-end wafer manufacturing partners in Taiwan include TSMC and UMC. The wafer test interface supplier is CHPT, and the back-end packaging and testing manufacturing partners include ASE Group, Siliconware Precision Industries Co. (SPIL), Unimicron, and Sporton. Partners in ultrasonic fingerprint recognition include ASE Holdings, Mirle Automation Corp, General Interface, and Nano Electronics and Micro System Technologies, Inc.The U.S. Department of Commerce released the latest semiconductor restrictions on China in October last year, extending the restrictions on logic integrated circuits to the memory category. In addition to Chinese-funded enterprises, foreign-funded production bases located in China now also need to apply for licenses on a case-by-case basis in order to continue to obtain manufacturing-related equipment.This year, the U.S. teamed up with the Netherlands and Japan to expand the restrictions on the sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.Under such circumstances, various OEM factories have begun to request the relocation of chip production. End products in the Chinese market can continue to use Chinese-made chips, but non-Chinese markets require the reduction or discontinuation of Chinese-made chips.As far as Qualcomm is concerned, as long as the end market for chips produced by Chinese wafer foundries and packaging and testing factories is outside China, the production supply chain will be transferred to Taiwan and South Korea, and Taiwan will be the most important recipient of these transfer orders, stated the Commercial Times.According to industry insiders, Qualcomm began to adjust the supply chain in response to geopolitical risks in the third quarter of last year and began to divert production away from China in the fourth quarter. Judging from current progress, it is anticipated that orders will be transferred to Taiwan's semiconductor production chain and mass production will begin in the second quarter of this year.Furthermore, Qualcomm's 4nm and 3nm wafer foundry orders are also concentrated in Taiwan, and TSMC is already the recipient of large orders.Qualcomm has sped up the move out of China by transferring orders to Taiwan's chip foundries and assembly/test firms, media reports, noting Qualcomm plans to increase Taiwan sourcing to NT$300 billion by 2024. $TSM $UMC $ASE $QCOM https://t.co/TGB0Mvj2OJ",2023/3/22,5229,Business

Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平) and Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a joint statement in which Moscow reiterated that it recognizes Taiwan “as an inalienable part of China's territory, opposes any form of ‘Taiwan independence’, and firmly supports China's measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
MOFA said that Taiwan and China are not subordinate to one another and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regime has never had the right to govern Taiwan for a day, per a MOFA press release. Taiwan is a modern democratic country that actively defends the democratic system and respects human rights and the rule of law, the ministry said.
The CCP authoritarian government has been violating human rights for years, arbitrarily expanding its reach, and bullying neighboring countries, MOFA added. “Any statement made by the CCP regime to distort Taiwan's sovereign status will not be able to change the internationally recognized cross-strait status quo.”










The foreign ministry also pointed out that China and Russia’s commitment to safeguard the U.N.-centric international system is “undoubtedly a deception.” Russia “flagrantly violated” the U.N. charter and illegally invaded Ukraine on February 24 last year, while China has been harassing Taiwan and neighboring countries with military aircraft and ships for a long time, it said.
“Today, the two countries talk loudly and call on the international community to abide by the U.N. Charter and avoid humanitarian crises.”
MOFA said that the serious harm to international peace and stability and the rules-based international order inflicted by China and Russia has caused more concern in the international community. “Taiwan is at the front line of defending democracy and the people and government of Taiwan will stand united to defend against China’s civil and military threats against the nation.”
The ministry pledged to also strengthen coordination and cooperation with democratic countries to curb the expansion of authoritarianism, safeguard peace and security across the Taiwan Strait, and maintain freedom and openness in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as global stability and prosperity.

While speculation initially focused on an accident, it soon became clear that Chen had swum away voluntarily and had been picked out of the water by the Chinese authorities.Responding to questions from lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan on Wednesday, National Security Bureau (NSB) Director-General Tsai Ming-yen (蔡明彥) said that the soldier had been interrogated by three separate Chinese government units in Xiamen, CNA reported. However, he was not willing to divulge the nature of those units as that would compromise the sources of his intelligence.The intelligence chief repeated assertions by other Taiwan government officials that Chen’s rank was low, and he was therefore not at risk of betraying useful confidential information about the frontline island to China.Prosecutors in Kinmen County issued a warrant for Chen’s arrest, with the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) applying to have him extradited from China.

This week, the court ruled in favor of the professor and declared that the university’s punishment was in violation of the law.Yang’s allegedly sexist and insensitive behavior was reported by female students in late 2019. The next year, he was mandated by the university to attend psychological counseling and attend eight hours of gender education courses outside of the university, but he refused to comply.The professor, who teaches courses on photography and image editing, frequently used images of scantily clad women as materials for course instruction, reported UDN. Students claimed that he often discussed pornography and made lewd remarks about female photo models and women’s underwear.The most serious allegations against the professor included a claim that he required female students to wear swimsuits for an end-of-semester photoshoot. Another was that he once made a female student sit on a male student’s lap to take a photograph.In Yang’s lawsuit disputing the allegations, he said the claims were unjustifiably exaggerated and that he never forced students to do anything against their will. He claimed the materials used in his class were meant to explain photographic techniques, and were in no way evidence of gender discrimination or harassment.According to Yang, he never coerced students in regards to clothing or posing for shoots. He only offered suggestions, which were voluntarily accepted.The Taipei High Court agreed with Yang, noting that professors should have the freedom to teach their lectures as they see fit.

Chen said that based on the latest data, domestic egg production gradually increased over last week.More than 31.5 million laying hens are now producing eggs every day and numbers are continuing to increase. Chen said weather conditions in central and southern Taiwan are ""very good,"" the southerly wind is blowing, and the temperatures have remained at a ""very good level.""Chen emphasized that with the assistance of local governments, the bird flu outbreak has been brought under control, enabling egg production to gradually recover.According to Chen, by the end of March, more than five million eggs will be imported. He said 30 million eggs would be imported in April and 30 million in May.For every five million eggs imported by air from Australia, the government subsidy is NT$30 million (US$984,000), so importing 30 million eggs could require NT$180 million in subsidies. When asked to comment on the potential for increased subsidies, Chen said they would not be as much because eggs are now being imported from eight countries, including the U.S., Australia, Japan, Brazil, Turkey, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia and some are shipped by sea.Chen said egg prices are determined by a small number of groups and there is a gap between the cost to produce eggs and the actual price. In the past, the daily market demand for eggs was 20 million per day and about 100,000 cartons were enough.He said demand is now 24 million eggs per day, an increase of 20%. But as to whether production capacity has increased, Chen said chicken farms are unwelcome in many communities and many county and city governments have imposed strict regulations on such facilities.Ched said that it is difficult to get the necessary permissions to build a poultry house and therefore they have to convert existing livestock farms instead.The COA head said that in response to concerns over a possible egg shortage last year, the daily inventory was adjusted to 30,000 cartons.

After his sentencing in 2001, he escaped to the Philippines where he continued to engage in criminal activity for the next 20 years, until he was apprehended by the Philippine Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) on March 1.TVBS reported that Manila wanted Chen to be tried in the Philippines for charges related to drug trafficking and gun smuggling. However, after several weeks of negotiations with Taiwan’s Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB), the decision was made to extradite Chen back to Taiwan.Chen was deported to Taiwan on Thursday (March 22) and arrived in Taipei that afternoon. It is expected he will serve out his previous sentence for kidnapping and that he will face trial for new charges related to his escape and recent activity in the Philippines.Over the last decade, Chen developed a reputation as a prolific arms dealer in Manila, known as the “Iron Tyrant” (鐵霸). He was found to be in possession of five pistols when he was arrested by Philippine police officers, reported TVBS.Chen’s arrest in early March led Philippine authorities to uncover a storehouse of illegal weapons in Metro Manila, which was raided earlier this week.",2023/3/22,4556,Society

Chu believes a consensus pick for the presidency can unite the party and avoid potential controversy that would hamstring the candidate.KMT mayors, county magistrates, and legislators will take part in the process to decide the strongest candidate, Chu added. Chu did not say when the candidate would be picked.Earlier this week, Chu described New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜) as the party's ""strongest hen,"" which in Taiwanese political speak refers to a party's strongest candidate.In 2015, the KMT’s Hung Hsiu-chu (洪秀柱), who was not considered the party’s strongest candidate, took part in the party's presidential primary and won, to the surprise of many. Hung was initially nominated as the KMT’s 2016 presidential candidate, but was later replaced amid controversy and as her poll numbers slid.Taiwan's presidential election is set to be held on January 13, 2024.

“Taiwan is a crucial country for the West,” Stewart said, adding that he encourages more lawmakers and ministers from the U.S., Canada, and European nations to visit Taiwan. “The more that politicians in Europe and U.S. and Canada understand what is happening here, the better.”
Stewart is currently leading a six-member delegation in Taiwan to meet with high-level government officials and discuss Taiwan-U.K. relations, developments in the region, and economic resilience.
The parliamentarian praised Taiwan for its achievements in democratic development, pointing out that what it achieved over 30 years has been “nothing more than miraculous."" Taiwan represents “huge democratic values” and is “on the frontlines of democracy and authoritarianism,” he said.










Stewart mentioned that the delegation had briefly talked about U.K. technical support in Taiwan’s submarine production endeavor. “The message we are taking back is that we should assist Taiwan in its defense as much as possible.”
The U.K. approved companies to export an unprecedented 167 million pounds (NT$6.25 million) worth of submarine-related equipment and technology during the first nine months of 2021, according to Reuters.
Stewart said he and his peers were happy to see the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier sailing in the Indo-Pacific region but lamented that it did not traverse the Taiwan Strait.
He reiterated that the U.K. Parliament is united on Taiwan, which is to give it “as much support as we can.”
The delegation includes fellow lawmakers Rob Butler, Sarah Atherton, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Afzal Khan, and Marie Rimmer.
The Chinese embassy in London protested the group’s trip, accusing the lawmakers of having “insisted on visiting the Taiwan region of China despite China’s resolute opposition.” This is a “gross interference in China’s internal affairs and a serious wrong signal to Taiwan independence separatist forces,” it added.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4843377,"Taiwan’s TSMC, ASML, Synopsys team up with Nvidia on computational lithography","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Nvidia announced on Tuesday (March 21) that it has partnered with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), ASML, and Synopsys to promote the use of its software library for computational lithography.
Nvidia’s new “cuLitho” software library for computational lithography will allow its partners to speed up the design and manufacturing of next-gen chips, according to Nvidia. Computational lithography is the use of mathematical pre-processing of a photomask file to adjust for aberrations and effects in optical lithography, according to eeNews Europe.
According to Nvidia, the advance will allow for chips with smaller transistors and wires than is now achievable, while also speeding up time to market and increasing energy efficiency of data centers to drive the manufacturing process. The computation underlying the lithographic patterning of advanced ICs can be made 40 times more efficient by running it on GPUs instead of general-purpose CPUs, eeNews Europe cited Nvidia as saying.
“It enables 500 Nvidia DGX H100 systems to achieve the work of 40,000 CPU systems, running all parts of the computational lithography process in parallel, helping to reduce power needs and potential environmental impact,” Nvidia said.










Fabs using cuLitho can produce three to five times more photomasks (templates for a chip’s design) per day, while using nine times less power than current setups, according to Nvidia. Meanwhile, a photomask that used to take two weeks can now be processed overnight, Nvidia added.
“With lithography at the limits of physics, Nvidia’s introduction of cuLitho and collaboration with our partners TSMC, ASML, and Synopsys allows fabs to increase throughput, reduce their carbon footprint and set the foundation for 2nm and beyond,” said Jensen Huang (黃仁勳), CEO and founder of Nvidia.
“This development opens up new possibilities for TSMC to deploy lithography solutions like inverse lithography technology and deep learning more broadly in chip manufacturing, making important contributions to the continuation of semiconductor scaling,” said C.C.

However, the likelihood of an armed incident can not be entirely excluded, Bush added.Taiwan and the U.S. need to be prepared for the possibility of military confrontation, with the common aim of reducing the risk of war in the first place, per CNA. Methods to do that include persuading China that Taiwan is not a red line and building an effective deterrent so Beijing would decide not to attack, Bush said.Bush estimated that in the case of a war, the U.S. would need one month to arrive on the scene, while Taiwan at present does not have enough troops to defend its coast. In this light, he approved of President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) decision to extend compulsory military service to one year, while emphasizing the importance of a well-trained reservist force.The former AIT chairman called on Taiwan’s political parties to work out a joint approach which could include a demand for China to stay neutral during Taiwan elections, a consensus about Taiwanese economic dependence on China, and a rejection of Beijing’s “One Country, Two Systems” formula as a topic for cross-strait talks.",2023/3/22,1528,Politics

At 9:10 a.m. on Tuesday (March 23), Taiwan High Court Kaohsiung Branch Court upheld the sentence, but the ruling can still be appealed.The court said Liang denied he intentionally murdered the victim and did not show any signs of remorse. After conducting two appraisals, it was determined the defendant was at ""high risk"" of recidivism, presented a defensive attitude, did not acknowledge his mistakes, and showed no empathy for the victim.The court added it is ""difficult to have a reasonable expectation of rectification and education, reducing the likelihood of social reintegration.""The court deemed Liang's actions to be the ""most serious crime."" After considering the circumstances of Article 57 of the Criminal Law and the sentencing appraisal reports, the defendant was sentenced to death in accordance with the law to match the crime and level of responsibility and the deprivation of civic rights.At 8 p.m. on Oct. 28, 2019, a 24-year-old Malaysian surnamed Chung (鍾) was walking to her dormitory from Chang Jung Christian University (CJCU) campus near Changda Road close to the viaduct of the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) Shalun Line. She disappeared after walking north along the underpass beneath the viaduct.Liang later confessed to using a rope to strangle Chung and drag her to his car. After murdering the student, Liang abandoned her body in a mountainous area of Kaohsiung City's Alian District.Chung's parents enlisted Taiwan Bar Association President Lin Jui-cheng (林瑞成) to take legal action against CJCU, the Taiwanese government, and the Tainan City Council for failing to take action that could have prevented the death of their daughter.

Senator Bill Hagerty pointed out that in February, CIA Director William Joseph Burns said China seeks to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027 and asked whether Blinken agreed with the assessment.Blinken agreed with the CIA assessment. Hagerty then said that ""time is not on our side"" as the U.S. has a US$19 billion dollar arms backlog with Taiwan.Hagerty said that is why he voted for the Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act (TERA) that was included in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act and provides Taiwan up to US$2 billion under the ""Foreign Military Finance"" (FMF) grant and loan assistance program designed to purchase U.S-made weapons and defense equipment between 2023 and 2027.However, Hagerty said that he was ""deeply disappointed"" to find that Biden's proposed budget for this year only includes US$113 million in FMF lines. He said the proposed budget ""assumes a mere US$16 million as a baseline for foreign military financing in the Indo-Pacific.""He then asked Blinken why the remaining funding was excluded from the budget. Blinken responded by saying the US$113 million request is part of the emerging priorities fund but in terms of Taiwan, and that FMF is ""one tool,"" as well as a drawdown authority, ""but we have looked at how we can be most effective in supporting Taiwan in its defense.""Blinken said the State Department has processed over the ""past decade or so"" nearly US$40 billion in military sales to Taiwan. Since 2019, Blinken said that there have been approximately US$21 billion in weapons sales to Taiwan.""I have signed out more cases than any secretary of state in history for Taiwan,"" Blinken said. He then highlighted the fact that Taiwan has boosted its defense budget by 11%.However, Hagerty said the State Department request period for Taiwan weapons acquisitions is far shorter than what has been allocated. He then asked whether the Chinese government had told Blinken or any other diplomats that there is ""some sort of red line"" when it comes to increased military financing for Taiwan.Blinken said this was not the case and if Beijing were to issue such statements, ""that's not something we would take into account."" He said that although he has signed off on more weapons deals than any predecessor, he acknowledged that there is a backlog of weapons orders, ""a very significant backlog.""Blinken said the backlog is the result of ""production challenges."" He said the Biden administration is working with U.S. manufacturers to bolster production capacity.""That is the long pole in the tent, and we need to address it,"" Blinken said.Hegarty closed by saying the U.S. missed an opportunity to use deterrence to prevent Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

It has been observed eating fruits and vegetables, and has not harmed any humans.Taoyuan's Animal Protection Office said the plan was to dispatch staff and capture the primate with a cage trap first, and if that failed, veterinarians would use a tranquilizer dart.After conducting an investigation, the office did not find any registration documentation for baboons in Taoyuan. Officials believe the monkey may have been abandoned by someone in a bordering country or city.Huang Chih-chieh (黃志杰), borough chief of Pingzhen's Xingli neighborhood, was cited by CNA as saying that on March 10, the baboon was spotted in a factory. On March 18, Huang received notification of the incident, and he contacted Leofoo Village Theme Park, in neighboring Hsinchu County, to dispatch veterinarians to capture the monkey.The baboon is about 110 centimeters tall and weighs around 20 kilograms.An individual who assisted in the efforts to capture the animal said that it is not afraid of humans.

ECA reported the average business trip to Hong Kong costs about US$520 (NT$15,800) each day, making it the 16th most expensive city on ECA’s global index.This year, Singapore edged out Tokyo for the No. 2 spot in the rankings. Daily costs for business travelers in Singapore are only slightly lower than Hong Kong’s at US$515 per day, over Tokyo’s US$424 dollars.As for Taiwan, its comparatively stable economy and successful COVID response put it in a healthy position for business activity. In comparison to other nations in the region suffering from heavy inflation and struggling to boost business post-pandemic, the demand for business travel to Taiwan has increased costs over many similarly sized cities in the region.Lee Quane, ECA’s regional director for Asia was quoted by the Hindustan Times, as saying, “The rise in our rankings of Taipei is largely due to the fact that locations such as Yokohama, Beijing and Macau, which were all more expensive before the COVID-19 pandemic, are now relatively cheaper than Taipei.""

The rise of Hsinchu into the top 10 reflects the global demand for semiconductors and related tech products and services.

Taiwan remains unbowed & continues to work as a force for good in the world.Pressure from China is leading more countries to switch allegiances and further Taiwan’s political isolation. The latest move by Honduras leaves Taiwan with 13 diplomatic allies, down from 21 in 2017.Today’s announcement comes days before Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) March 29 trip to visit Belize and Guatemala. The question was addressed by MOFA Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) at the press conference by a member of the foreign media.“I don’t have any evidence that these actions are coordinated. But the Chinese always try to thwart our diplomatic relations,” said Wu.Later, he addressed the potential of losing yet another diplomatic partner, Paraguay, which is in the midst of a competitive presidential election scheduled for April 30. Paraguay’s current president is sympathetic to Taiwan and considered an ally, though other candidates may be swayed by China.Wu noted that relations with Paraguay remain stable and a Paraguayan delegation headed by veteran Senator Blas Antonio Llano Ramos visited Taiwan last week to dispel rumors that diplomatic relations were in peril. Wu also called upon diplomatic allies to be aware of the false promises that China may offer.Wu said 61 Taiwanese nationals and family stationed in Honduras, including their family members, will leave the country or transfer to other countries as soon as possible.Despite the loss of Honduras, Wu said Taiwan has been fortunate to benefit from the support of the U.S. and other countries despite near constant pressure from China to suppress Taiwan’s international status.",2023/3/26,1875,Politics

Despite this long-term help, relations between Taiwan and Honduras could not withstand Chinese meddling.Lin warned Honduras not to be swayed by China's false promises, noting that continued negotiations with China regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations have seriously impacted Taiwan’s government and its people, leading the Presidential Office to express strong regret and condemnation.“The severance of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Honduras is part of a series of Chinese attacks and intimidation. China has suppressed the international space of Taiwan for a long time, unilaterally endangering regional peace and stability,” said Lin.Lin added that nothing can change the fact that, “Taiwan and China are not affiliated to each other, nor can they destroy the will of the people of Taiwan to love freedom and democracy, and embrace the world.”Furthermore, Lin said that recent events such as the COVID pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the earthquake in Turkey, have been aided by Taiwan’s participation.

The requests included aid for a hospital, a hydropower dam, and sovereign debt assistance and totaled more than US$2.4 billion (NT$74.3 billion), per Storm Media.According to Wu, the requests were unreasonable and potentially linked to negotiations with China for a similar economic assistance package. He said the release of false or misleading information potentially harms Taiwan’s international image.In the past, Wu said MOFA carefully planned all economic aid to allies and typically did not provide direct “cash assistance.""A Honduran economic assistance request was received on March 13. (CNA photo)Before severing diplomatic relations with Taiwan, Honduras requested US$45 million in aid for the construction of a hospital, which was raised to US$90 million in the second appeal.In addition, Honduras asked for assistance to build a hydroelectric dam, initially US$300 million then raised to US$350 million. Honduras also asked Taiwan to help cover the Honduran sovereign debt of US$2 billion.Wu said turning over US$90 million to build a hospital was akin to bribery, especially since a second request to build a hospital had inflated prices. Wu said it felt like Honduras was “simply asking for money, and not a hospital.”According to Wu, China may fail to hold up its end of the bargain with Taiwan's former allies after they switch political recognition.",2023/3/26,2366,Politics

“The mission of this project is to build a platform inviting new Czech and Taiwanese partners in various sectors and become the bridge between the Czech Republic and Taiwan,” Speaker of the Czech Chamber of Deputies Marketa Pekarova Adamova said at the opening ceremony Monday morning. Adamova said she hopes the opening of this office will encourage other nations “to create similar hubs in Taipei to develop their relationship with Taiwan.”
In addition to business affairs, the hub will also serve as a space to “assist in building the Czech community in Taiwan,” the speaker said. Government support from Taiwan and the Czech Republic was instrumental in establishing this office, she added.
Adamova told Taiwan News that her trip is intended to strengthen bilateral ties. Though they are already solid, “good friends should work on their relationship,” she said.










“There is great space” for bilateral cooperation between Taiwan and Czech companies, especially in the AI and semiconductor industries, she said.
Meanwhile, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Roy Chun Lee (李淳) said the hub demonstrates the Czech Republic is not in Taiwan “just for fun.”
“They’re here to stay. We’re talking about long-term partnership. Not only in the business community but also between think tanks, great minds, and the exchange of ideas,” Lee said.
The deputy director said companies have now realized there are “hidden agendas” when doing business in China. He acknowledged that by moving to Taiwan, the economic value may be smaller but “you have a much higher level of peace of mind. You have a much higher level of confidence in doing business.”
Lee pointed out that interest in expanding business goes both ways. “Almost all major Taiwan ICT companies have already established some sort of operation in the Czech Republic in the last five years,” he said. The Czech Republic is one of the most competitive and attractive destinations in Europe, he said.
The Czech Hub is located in the Gengxi Building (耕曦大廈) at No. 18, Lane 26, Pucheng Street, Da’an District, Taipei City.

Premier Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁) and Minister of Culture Shih Che (史哲) responded, saying that “de-authorization” and “de-individualization” is the consensus between both major parties.Critics of the military guard believe it symbolizes reverence for Taiwan’s authoritarian past, and suggest that the soldiers be moved to guard the flag platform, thus solving the problem of alleged “dictator loyalty” while protecting the guard’s sightseeing value. However, under-secretary for the Ministry of Culture Sue Wang (王時思) told Watchout that ongoing discussions between her ministry and the Ministry of Defense have hit upon a key disagreement; that the latter believes it's inappropriate for the guard to become a purely sightseeing attraction.Wang said that Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall is under the supervision of the Ministry of Education and that while she thinks the guards are inappropriate, her ministry still needs to coordinate with the Ministry of Defense on the matter. She said that in addition to the memorial hall, the Sun Yat-sen memorial hall and the Chiang family mausoleum in Taoyuan still need to be discussed.In 2007, the Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) government removed the guard, renamed the hall National Taiwan Democracy Hall, and the surrounding grounds Liberty Square.

The committee's chair, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, started off by warning the American public that ""TikTok is a weapon by the Chinese Communist Party to spy on you and manipulate what you see and exploit for future generations.""Early on during her questioning of Chew, Rodgers asked if the platform's moderation tools had been used to delete content relating to the Uyghur Genocide. Chew responded by claiming that TikTok does not remove such content and is a ""place of freedom of expression.""The chair then asked whether the content about the Tiananmen Massacre is removed from TikTok. After first claiming to have not heard the question, and following Rodgers repeating ""the massacre in Tiananmen Square,"" Chew said, ""That kind of content is available on our platform."" Rodgers then warned Chew that ""making false or misleading statements to Congress is a federal crime.""Rodgers next asked him if he could say ""with 100% certainty that Bytedance or the CCP cannot use your company, or its divisions, to make content to promote pro-CCP messages for an act of aggression against Taiwan?"" Chew responded by saying that TikTok does not promote or remove content at the request of Beijing.She then repeated her question to confirm that he is 100% certain that the CCP cannot use TikTok to push such messaging. Chew replied that it is TikTok's ""commitment to this committee and all our users that we will keep this free from any manipulation by any government.""Rodgers said that if Chew is unable to ensure with 100% certainty that the CCP cannot use TikTok as a propaganda platform in this way, ""I'll take that as a no.""Dan Ives, managing director of New York-based Wedbush Securities, was cited by AP as saying that Chew's failure to provide concrete answers to concerns about data access and security was “a disaster” and probably has laid the groundwork for a ban. Jasmine Enberg, a social media analyst at Insider Intelligence, told the news agency that Chew's choice to highlight TikTok's reach in the U.S. might have had the reverse desired effect and “actually strengthened U.S. lawmakers’ argument that TikTok poses a threat to both national security and young people.”During a U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on global security threats held on March 8, committee vice chairman Marco Rubio asked FBI Director Christopher Wray if it is plausible that during preparations to invade Taiwan, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could use TikTok to ""make sure Americans are seeing videos arguing why Taiwan belongs to China"" and why the U.S. should not intervene.

What he neglected to mention was that the declaration referred to the government of the Republic of China (ROC), which is now based in Taiwan.He alleged that the CCP's capture of Beijing in 1949 made the People's Republic of China (PRC) the ""successor to the Republic of China."" The ROC, however, currently continues to function as a government based in Taipei.The ambassador described the current situation across the Taiwan Strait as a ""protracted political confrontation."" He alleged that the territory of China has ""never been divided and will never be divided"" although China and Taiwan have separate governments with different militaries, currencies, passports, constitutions, and diplomatic allies.Xiao then cited Resolution 2758 passed by the United Nations in 1971 as ""making it clear there is but one China in the world"" with Taiwan a part of that country. The brief resolution actually says it recognizes the PRC government as the ""only lawful representatives of China,"" while the ""representatives of Chiang Kai-Shek"" are to be expelled, thus potentially leaving the door open for future Taiwan membership under a government not ruled by Chiang's ""representatives"" and not as a part of China.He wrote that Beijing's ""first choice"" is ""reunification by peaceful means."" Yet, as the ROC was never united with the PRC and Taiwan has never been ruled by the PRC, the term ""reunification"" is inaccurate.Xiao then warned that Beijing ""will not leave any room for any form of 'Taiwan independence' separatist activities."" He also railed against Australians who express concerns about a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, comparing them to Don Quixote ""tilting at windmills, fighting against a non-existent enemy.""A poll conducted by the Lowy Institute in 2022 revealed that 63% of Australians believe China is ""more of a security threat"" to their country, while only 33% think of Beijing as ""more of an economic partner."" As of that year, Australians who said they trust China had plummeted by 40 points from 2018 to only 12%.",2023/3/24,7356,Politics

Austin said on Thursday (March 23) that he has formed a ""Tiger Team"" to ensure that Taiwan's military needs are met amid rising threats from China and ""logjams"" with weapons orders due to the war in Ukraine.During a hearing of the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee, Congressman Ken Calvert said every Taiwanese leader he met with during his recent visit to Taiwan had ""remarked at the extremely slow pace of U.S. defense articles."" He asked Austin and Joint Chiefs of Staff Army General Mark A. Milley what are Ukraine and Taiwan's ""most critical defense needs"" and what steps are being taken to expedite the shipment of weapons.Austin responded by acknowledging ""headwinds"" due to the pandemic's impact on supply chains and struggles U.S. manufacturers have had keeping up with demand. He expressed optimism that U.S. weapons makers will eventually be able to alleviate the backlog in Foreign Military Sales (FMS).The Secretary of Defense said that he created a ""Tiger Team"" months ago to deal with FMS shortfalls and ""identify logjams and work through those logjams"" to expedite production of crucial weapons systems. He also formed a group of senior leaders in the Department of Defense to focus on the issue on a weekly basis ""to make sure that we are providing the right kinds of capability that Taiwan needs.""Austin closed by saying ""this remains an area of focus for the department.""According to a report by The Wall Street Journal in September 2022, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen H. Hicks signed a memorandum in August to establish a ""Tiger Team"" led by Sasha Baker, deputy under secretary of defense in charge of weapons procurement and logistical support.

The new engines will be more reliable, resilient, and easier to maintain, according to the military.The main target for the M60A3 during an armed conflict would be China’s amphibious landing vehicles, which would be at their most vulnerable while operating on beaches due to the absence of heavy armored plating.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845701,US House passes Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday (March 22) passed a bill that would require the State Department to carry out periodic reviews of its guidelines for American engagement with Taiwan no less than every two years.
The Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act passed with an overwhelming 404-7 vote, according to CNA. The bill was introduced on Feb. 24 by Representative Ann Wagner and amends the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020.
In a statement announcing the measure, Wagner said the regular reviews and updates must explain how the guidance deepens and expands relations between the U.S. and Taiwan. State Department updates would also be required to “give due consideration to the fact that Taiwan is a democratic partner and a free and open society that respects universal human rights and democratic values.”
In addition, updates need to “ensure that the conduct of relations with Taiwan reflects the longstanding, comprehensive, and values-based relationship the United States shares with Taiwan, and contribute to the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.” And lastly, reviews must “identify opportunities to lift any remaining self-imposed limitations on U.S.-Taiwan engagement and articulate a plan to do so.”










Wagner noted that for decades most senior American executive branch officials were banned from visiting Taiwan in order not to anger China, while top Taiwanese officials were not able to travel to the U.S. Meanwhile, meetings between officials from the two countries had to comply with a long list of cumbersome and arbitrary rules, such as having meetings in hotels instead of official federal buildings, Wagner said.
In January 2021, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said all of those guidelines were null and void. However, many of these restrictions have since been put back in place by the Biden administration, Wagner said.
Wagner also added that Taiwan is now facing an “unprecedented threat” from China and that the U.S. needs to stand by its friends and partners, particularly Taiwan. “We must increase our economic ties, defense relationship, and political support of Taiwan’s democratic system, and this bill will support these goals.”
The only opposition to the House bill came from seven Democrats; Jamaal Bowman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Delia Ramirez, according to The Hill. The bill will now need to be passed in the Senate before it can be sent to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law, not signed, or vetoed.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday (March 22) passed a bill that would require the State Department to carry out periodic reviews of its guidelines for American engagement with Taiwan no less than every two years.The Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act passed with an overwhelming 404-7 vote, according to CNA.

The student showed him a copy of an English-to-Chinese dictionary that he wanted help with.The dictionary, titled ""Children's Illustrated Dictionary"" (Hello Kitty 兒童英漢辭典) is printed by ACME Cultural Enterprise Co. (世一文化事業股份有限公司) and is the most recent edition, printed in June 2020.Smith noticed mistakes in the dictionary, including typos, parts of speech, and example sentences. For instance, the entry for ""rice"" was spelled ""rest.""The word ""imagine"" was listed as a verb but has the letter ""n"" for noun in English. The example sentence for ""birthday"" read ""Happy birghday.""Under the ""Revision Editor"" notes in the front of the book, the word ""Language"" is misspelled as ""Languagc."" Smith observed that there are dated usages not appropriate for children, such as references to smoking.Smith said that after reading through the dictionary twice, he found over 60 ""egregious errors."" In October last year, he contacted the publisher and notified them of the typos.He said he was initially offered a refund for the NT$320 (US$10.50) cost of the dictionary that his student's secretary bought from Kinokuniya. Smith was not satisfied with this response.Instead, he advised the company to recall the dictionaries because it's ""not just embarrassing for you, but for Taiwan in general, and also for Taiwan's education system."" He added that it ""flies in the face of the government's Bilingual 2030 campaign.""Company representatives said they would get back to him in a week or so, but failed to do so. In January, he shared his findings with Johanne Murray, who is a lecturer in the Department of English at Wenzao Ursuline University of Languages and PhD candidate of business management at National Sun Yat-sen University.Murray told Taiwan News that she was shocked at what she described as a ""poor product that doesn't deserve to represent the Made-in-Taiwan brand."" She compiled a 47-page PDF annotating many of the more blatant errors, discovering another 10 mistakes in the process, bringing the total number of typos in the dictionary to at least 70.In January, Murray sent the PDF to two local educators and an official at the Ministry of Education (MOE). However, over two months later, she has yet to receive a response from any of these individuals.Murray said of the error-ridden book: ""It shows a lack of concern for consumers, their brand name, and their partner Sanrio.""She added that as a parent she would be really upset if she discovered her child was exposed to such content, and as a teacher, she would not want to give it out to her students.Smith informed a government official who contacted the company about the matter. A company representative sent a response via the social media app LINE acknowledging that there had been errors in the dictionary.Furthermore, it said the editor had been notified, and after discussions were held with their foreign consultant, the corrections would be included in the next edition.The company claimed the typesetting had been outsourced to an outside company. It acknowledged that there were many mistakes after proofreading and if readers find errors they are welcome to report them to the publisher via email. It also pledged to reply and deal with the issues.On Saturday (March 25), Taiwan News purchased a copy of the 2020 edition at the Hess Bookstore in Taipei City's Zhongshan District and all the reported errors were present.

He is said to be meeting with Song Tao (宋濤), the new director of the Cabinet-level Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO).Asked whether Ma was likely to meet other officials, MAC Minister Chiu Tai-san (邱太三) told a radio interview Friday it was highly likely that an official more senior than Song would meet the former president “by coincidence,” but according to current information, that probably would not be Xi, Radio Taiwan International (RTI) reported. When Ma was still president of Taiwan and chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT), he met Xi in Singapore in 2015.Chiu called on Ma to be vigilant about letting himself be used, as Chinese propaganda departments had gone three years without showing any results for their work, so they might try and make up for lost time. With presidential elections coming up in Taiwan next January, the public should pay close attention, the minister said.As the MAC was closely monitoring developments, including Xi’s itinerary, it was unlikely that Ma and Xi would meet again. One candidate for a meeting was Wang Huning (王滬寧), the new chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and the fourth-ranking member of the Politburo, according to Chiu.",2023/3/24,1273,Politics

He said that both the U.S. and Taiwan have a role in deterring a Chinese invasion, and that defenses along Taiwan’s China-facing west coast should be improved using the country’s skilled workforce and advanced technology.O’Brien also said that Taiwanese should be firearm trained and this would be a massive deterrent. “Think how rattled it would make the leadership of the CCP if they knew that if they invaded there would be 1 million Taiwanese with an AK47,” he said.O’Brien said he recognized that the culture was different in Taiwan and America, and that guns were a sensitive issue, but did not hold back when expressing his belief in arming Taiwanese citizens, comparing a possible future Chinese invasion of Taiwan to the war in Ukraine. “Those legitimate concerns around gun ownership concerns or gun safety pale in comparison when we look at the war crimes that have taken place,” he said.Safeguards could be put in place to ensure weapons weren’t misused, O’Brien said. He suggested public armories or personal safes could be used to store firearms.Guns are tightly controlled in Taiwan, with a legal amendment allowing Taiwan’s police to fire guns at suspects suspected of using lethal weapons only being passed in October last year.When asked about Honduras’ recent decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, O’Brien said that while there were important benefits gained for Taiwanese from having formal diplomatic allies, Taiwan’s relationship with the U.S. was “far more important.""“As important as diplomatic relations are, the integrity of the country, the anti-corruption stance of the country both in Taiwan and in the U.S. is more important,” he said.O’Brien said the Trump and Biden administrations have both worked with Taiwan and the countries that still maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan to deter them from switching recognition from China.During O’Brien’s visit, he served as the chair of the Global Taiwan Institute's Task Force on U.S.-Taiwan Relations.

Details of the mechanism will be announced in a week, Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Chi-chung (陳吉仲) said at a meeting of the Central Emergency Operation Center (CEOC) on Friday (March 24).The move follows a spike in cases of pork products being intercepted at the borders, either brought in by passengers or through mail and shipping.Between August 2018 and March 22 this year, Taiwan impounded 5,294 pork items at the borders, 470 of them testing positive for ASF. The four Asian countries of China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia are the countries from which most violations were reported, according to CEOC.Taiwan has battled to keep the virus away with hefty fines, having stayed free from ASF after 17 Asian countries recorded infections. As of March 20, 121 arrivals had been fined NT$200,000 (US$6,591) each, an alarming figure compared to the 170 cases in the whole of 2022.The authorities believe the surge in pork import incidents can be attributed to revived travel and declined vigilance, hence the need for repeated warnings and new inspection measures.COA is also stepping up a crackdown on swine farms illegally using food waste as feed. Some farmers have turned to kitchen waste due to the rising cost of pig feed.A visitor was fined NT$200,000 for bringing in pork pastry products from Vietnam.

Yui pointed out that China’s efforts were marked by broken promises linked to projects that include a canal between the Atlantic and the Pacific in Nicaragua, and airports and harbors in El Salvador.In contrast, Taiwan has recently become an important partner for Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico in the fields of economy, culture, science and technology, Yui told the Spanish-language news service Tuesday (March 21).He said that if Taiwan wanted to open an embassy in Buenos Aires, it would not ask Argentina to end diplomatic relations with China, per UDN.

Since new concepts are not always immediately applied, Chan said that the software allows users to create and store notes about concepts they are learning and access them when it is time to apply that knowledge.Chan said he found Heptabase’s first users via social media app Telegram. He said he searched ""visual, whiteboard, mind map,"" on Telegram, found interested users, and sent them a prototype so that they could provide feedback.“So, the community grew organically; it went from zero to one to five, to now I think about 6000 members across 82 countries,” Chan said.

Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio Garcia issued the order on local television on Monday, following the government's announcement over the weekend that it had opened formal diplomatic relations with Beijing while simultaneously ending its decades-long relationship with Taiwan.
Castro's main conservative opposition later announced it would reverse the opening to China if it regains power.
China has long-argued that democratically ruled Taiwan is part of its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties, a position Taipei strongly rejects. Communist-run China demands that countries it has ties with must adopt its position.
Taipei's embassy in Tegucigalpa's leafy Palmira neighborhood was for years one of the Central American capital's most prominent foreign outposts, as well as the country's second-biggest embassy after the U.S. embassy.
In his remarks, Garcia said 30 days ""is more than enough time to pack up and leave,"" adding that officials aim for an ""orderly, friendly"" exit.
The deputy minister also stressed the need for a diplomatic mission to the world's second-biggest economy.
""We have to go there to explore the big projects that China can give us,"" he said, suggesting that China could invest some $10 billion in Honduras in a boon for local workers.
The foreign ministry also announced that Honduran students with scholarships in Taiwan would be able to transfer their studies to China.
Late on Saturday, the Honduran foreign ministry recognized the People's Republic of China, China's formal name, as the only legitimate government that represents all of China and that Taiwan is an ""inseparable part of Chinese territory.""
The move leaves Taiwan with only 13 formal allies, mostly poor and developing countries in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.
In its own statement later on Monday, the conservative National Party pledged to re-establish ties with Taiwan if it can retake the Honduran presidency in 2026.
""We will do the impossible to restore relations with our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Taiwan,"" it said, promising to enshrine allegiance to Taiwan in the country's constitution.TEGUCIGALPA, March 27 (Reuters) - Taiwan must vacate its embassy in Honduras within 30 days, a senior Honduran official said on Monday, after President Xiomara Castro severed ties with Taiwan in favor of China in a bid for more investment and jobs from the Asian giant.Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio Garcia issued the order on local television on Monday, following the government's announcement over the weekend that it had opened formal diplomatic relations with Beijing while simultaneously ending its decades-long relationship with Taiwan.Castro's main conservative opposition later announced it would reverse the opening to China if it regains power.China has long-argued that democratically ruled Taiwan is part of its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties, a position Taipei strongly rejects. Communist-run China demands that countries it has ties with must adopt its position.Taipei's embassy in Tegucigalpa's leafy Palmira neighborhood was for years one of the Central American capital's most prominent foreign outposts, as well as the country's second-biggest embassy after the U.S. embassy.In his remarks, Garcia said 30 days ""is more than enough time to pack up and leave,"" adding that officials aim for an ""orderly, friendly"" exit.The deputy minister also stressed the need for a diplomatic mission to the world's second-biggest economy.""We have to go there to explore the big projects that China can give us,"" he said, suggesting that China could invest some $10 billion in Honduras in a boon for local workers.The foreign ministry also announced that Honduran students with scholarships in Taiwan would be able to transfer their studies to China.Late on Saturday, the Honduran foreign ministry recognized the People's Republic of China, China's formal name, as the only legitimate government that represents all of China and that Taiwan is an ""inseparable part of Chinese territory.""The move leaves Taiwan with only 13 formal allies, mostly poor and developing countries in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.In its own statement later on Monday, the conservative National Party pledged to re-establish ties with Taiwan if it can retake the Honduran presidency in 2026.""We will do the impossible to restore relations with our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Taiwan,"" it said, promising to enshrine allegiance to Taiwan in the country's constitution.",2023/3/28,4881,Politics

However, agricultural bureau personnel soon discovered that the primate had suffered a gunshot wound and despite undergoing emergency medical treatment, it soon died.Police then launched an investigation and summoned 13 people from the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture, Hsinchu County Department of Agriculture, and Leofoo Village Theme Park. On Tuesday morning (March 28), a hunter surnamed Lin (林) was sent to the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office to be investigated for violating the Wildlife Conservation Act (野生動物保育法), reported UDN.Lin inside Yangmei Precinct of Taoyuan Police Department on Monday. (Taoyuan Police Department photo)The Taoyuan Department of Agriculture alleges that Lin was not entrusted by the department to assist in the capture of the animal, and he was not authorized to shoot. Staff from Leofoo Village fired a tranquilizer dart at the monkey, but missed and did not know that it had already been shot with a firearm.After police questioned the 13 individuals involved in the capture of the monkey, Lin was listed as a suspect. One staff member each from the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture, the Hsinchu Department of Agriculture, and Leofoo Village, as well as another hunter, were listed as parties involved in the incident and were also sent to the prosecutor's office to be investigated for breaching the Wildlife Conservation Act.According to the police investigation, Lin is a legal hunter with a hunting rifle license and was contracted by the Hsinchu County Department of Agriculture. When the baboon was found to be hiding inside a house in Fugang, Lin and three agriculture department personnel entered the house first.(Taoyuan Police Department photo)At the time, the house was dark, and agriculture department staff had called on Lin to use a flashlight to search the home. However, the baboon reportedly rushed at Lin, prompting him to fire a shot that struck the animal's left chest and exited its back.The baboon began to bleed profusely and agriculture department personnel and Leofoo Village staff then entered the house. Fearing that the monkey would attack again, they fired a tranquilizer at it.They then used a net to seize the animal. After they removed it from the house, they discovered that it was badly bleeding. Department of Agriculture personnel rushed the baboon to the Leofoo Village for emergency treatment, but it succumbed to its wounds.(Taoyuan Police Department photo)Lin admitted to Yangmei Precinct police that he killed the baboon and told them he was a legally authorized hunter with a license to operate his hunting rifle. He said while he was out bird hunting in Hsinchu County's Hukou Township, he was asked by the Hsinchu County Department of Agriculture to assist with the capture of the baboon.He said he was concerned that the baboon might attack the people present and claimed that he only opened fire after receiving consent from the people present. However, Hsinchu County Department of Agriculture employees present denied that they issued this permission.Police confirmed that Lin is indeed a legally authorized hunter with a permit to use a hunting rifle. They said he was not commissioned by the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture to take part in the hunt for the baboon in Taoyuan City.(CNA photo)Since the staff from the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture, Hsinchu Department of Agriculture, Leofoo Village, and Lin all have differing accounts, police will conduct a more in-depth investigation.",2023/3/28,2646,Society

He added that The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine purportedly plans to use these drones for a counterattack on Crimea.In a comment under the tweet, he pointed out that he prefaced the original post with the acronym RUMINT, which he described as ""Rumor intelligence"" and emphasized that this is not verified. He said the information had been spreading on Russian and Ukrainian channels and justified uploading the post because ""I have reasons to believe Taiwan has provided something,"" but that he did not know what it was.The National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST, 中科院) on March 14 unveiled a new domestically-developed kamikaze drone similar to the U.S. Switchblade. The new drone can be carried in a backpack, is launched from a tube, and can reach a target about 10 kilometers away.Newtalk on Monday reported that some Taiwanese netizens have speculated that gifting these suicide drones to Ukraine would enable Taiwan's military to conduct a ""live demonstration"" of its new military drones. This would allegedly deter China by demonstrating the performance of the drones in Eastern Europe without directly provoking Beijing in the Taiwan Strait.However, MOFA on Tuesday issued a press release in which it stressed that the information provided in the tweet was not true. The ministry said it will promptly collect the relevant screenshots and false news reports and present them to the police.The ministry urged the public not to trust information from unknown sources on the internet and to not spread false information or rumors to avoid violating the law.

CM Media cited a source familiar with the matter that Taiwan is preparing to purchase large missile trucks and 155 mm eight-wheel self-propelled howitzers, and will engage in cooperation on the development of military drones, with the deal expected to close soon and included in the next year's budget.Adamova is heading a delegation of 160 members that arrived in Taiwan on Saturday (March 25). The delegation includes Michal Koudelka, head of the counter-intelligence Security Information Service (BIS); Lukas Kintr, director of the National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NUKIB); and other high-level security officials appointed by the new president of the Czech Republic, Petr Pavel.The source said the two countries are planning on conducting in-depth exchanges and cooperation in the military, combating disinformation, cybersecurity, semiconductors, and the military aerospace industry. In terms of military procurements, the source revealed that Taiwan is planning to purchase about 200 to 400 12-wheel large semi-trailer trucks, which would be used to transport Taiwanese missiles such as the Yun Feng surface-to-surface, supersonic cruise missile.Under the guidance of the National Security Council, Taiwan and the Czech Republic have already reportedly discussed the procurement of vehicles in July 2022. The current delegation has been sent to further the talks, and the agreement has almost been finalized, according to the news site.As for the purchase of the 155 mm eight-wheel self-propelled howitzers, Taiwan's previous application for the purchase of 40 M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers from the U.S. was to cost about NT$17.3 billion (US$569 million), which was approved by former President Donald Trump.However, President Joe Biden scuttled the deal citing reasons such as the war in Ukraine and production line bottlenecks. Instead, the Biden administration offered the M142 HIMARS system as an alternative.According to the news agency, Taiwan had already established communications over possible arms deals with the Czech Republic in 2020. It cited military experts as saying the Czech Republic's 155 mm self-propelled howitzer is more advanced than the M109A2 and A5 currently used by the Taiwanese military, but slightly inferior to the M109A6.The name of the system was not provided, but the DITA 155mm Self-Propelled Howitzer is in development, and the Morana 155 mm Self-Propelled Howitzer was unveiled in 2022.The Czech delegation also includes personnel from the military aerospace industry.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849130,Taiwanese diplomacy after Honduras,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — In the 1990s, a blueprint for Taiwanese diplomacy prioritized a “three pillars” approach: formal diplomatic relationships first, followed by Taiwan’s unofficial relationships, and lastly, participation in international organizations. However, according to National Chengchi University Department of Diplomacy Chair Professor Yeh-chung Lu (盧業中), the contemporary global environment is challenging this approach.Speaking to Taiwan News on Honduras’ recent decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China on Tuesday (March 28), Lu said the country’s local conditions conflict with the values of freedom, human rights, and democracy that Taiwan employs when seeking to improve its unofficial relationships with developed democracies like the U.S., Japan, and EU countries. He said this is also an issue for some of Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic allies, meaning challenges for Taiwan when working to improve relationships with its informal allies.“In other words, if we continue to put resources on the ‘second pillar,’ then our traditional diplomatic allies may feel betrayed,” he said. If Taiwan continues to commit support to formal diplomatic allies that are not democratized or committed to human rights, then how can Taiwan convince its informal diplomatic allies, ""especially advanced stable democracies, that we are going to contribute to the international community?” Lu asked.Is U.S. power in Central America waning?Despite commentators suggesting that U.S. weakness in the region was the reason for the switch, Lu believes the Honduran President Xiomara Castro, who has been in office since January 2022, played a central role. “I believe when president Castro was inaugurated she would have cut off the ties immediately, so I think the U.S. actually helped Taiwan to keep them longer, for at least a few months.”He said U.S. support ultimately failed to protect the Honduras-Taiwan relationship because of reported financial arrangements President Castro made for herself and her family with the Chinese government. “China, to my knowledge, has been in touch with Honduras’ political elites for a very long time, so I think President Castro is the key figure in the decision-making in Honduras on this issue,” he said.Tsai’s upcoming Central American tripDespite the switch outwardly appearing as something of a humiliation to the Taiwanese government, Lu said that Taiwan’s career diplomats deserve to be recognized for the way they handled the situation. He said he believes Taiwan’s diplomats in Honduras had known for some time about the possibility of a diplomatic switch, and that they used this knowledge to help the Presidential Office plan President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) upcoming Central American Trip beginning March 21.“I think this kind of information has been transmitted to the president's office in Taiwan,” Lu said, allowing the Office to avoid a face-to-face meeting between Tsai and Castro. “If both Presidents met and Taiwan made some commitment, but Honduras said they would cut off the ties by the end of the year anyway, that would be a huge setback to Taiwan.”Quality versus quantityPresident Tsai said on Sunday (March 26) that Taiwan refused to ""engage in a meaningless contest of dollar diplomacy with China,"" after Taiwan’s foreign minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) revealed that growing Honduran aid requests had resulted in the breaking of ties between the two countries, adding that Taiwan did not provide direct “cash assistance."" Paraguay, whose election in April threatens yet another diplomatic break for Taiwan reportedly also asked for massive aid increases to maintain ties with Taiwan, though Paraguayan officials have since denied this.According to Lu, these revelations are cause for considering what kinds of allies Taiwan wants to have, referencing the outgoing President of the Federated States of Micronesia’s (FSM) open letter to the country’s parliament calling for the switch of diplomatic relations to Taiwan from China. President Tsai and Minster Wu’s comments may mean “people will think that Taiwan is now focusing on real friends instead of the total number of allies, so people will consider if Micronesia really is one of them,” Lu said.Lu had heard talks about a possible diplomatic switch going back about two years, saying, ""some people on the Taiwan side already spoke about this but in terms of the size of the country, it’s very small, only the population of one district in New Taipei."" Despite its small size, if FSM did switch diplomatic recognition to Taiwan, it would still be a victory, Lu reasoned.The FSM President’s letter claimed that NT$1.5 billion (US$50 million), an additional US$15 million annually in healthcare, scholarships, and training programs “can, and will” be received by the FSM “if and when” the country switches diplomatic relations from China to Taiwan. Minister Wu confirmed to the legislature on March 10 that he had ""indeed contacted and exchanged views"" with the FSM President, but did not comment on alleged promises of aid.",2023/3/28,1844,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849174,"Former congressman says US needs clear, consistent messaging on Taiwan","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Washington needs to have a clear statement and consistent messaging on Taiwan, former U.S. Congressman Robert Pittenger said in Taipei on Monday (March 27).
Talking to Taiwan News, Pittenger said, “My interest in coming to Taiwan is to have a global forum to bring nations here from all over to be better informed, to be briefed by the experts from industry, from governments, (and) from think tanks. It’s called the Parliamentary Intelligence-Security Forum.”
Pittenger is currently the chairman of the Parliamentary Intelligence-Security Forum (PI-SF), which has hosted 24 in-person forums with over 1,700 parliamentarians and government officials from 96 countries. PI-SF’s mission is to provide expertise and collaboration among members of parliament and government officials to increase American allies' understanding of global threats from adversarial nation-states, while providing actionable solutions to counter these threats.
“We want to have one here and bring hundreds of parliamentarians from around the world to Taiwan,” Pittenger said.










When asked in what ways Taiwan and the U.S. could boost security collaboration, the former congressman mentioned supply chains. He noted that if Taiwan were to be taken over by China, it would be considered a major security threat to the U.S., due to Washington’s reliance on Taiwan-made chips.
Pittenger then said America needs to have a clear statement on Taiwan. He noted that since Biden took office, the president has made several public statements in support of Taiwan, only to have them walked back by White House officials. The former congressman said Washington needs to have clear, consistent messaging on Taiwan “so you know who you’re counting on.”
While the Taiwanese have long been aware of the dangers posed by China, Pittenger said Americans are also increasingly cognizant of the threat. “The politicians are following the people. Politicians have an innate desire to get reelected, and they do read polls. And there are polls saying that China is not a friendly competitor, it is a major adversary. The American public gets it, which is why now, U.S. politicians get it,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849192,North Taiwan officials bow to baboon after botched capture,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Top Taoyuan Department of Agriculture officials on Tuesday (March 28) bowed at the body of the deceased baboon and apologized to the public for the firing of live ammunition at the animal and the posing of staff members for photos rather than tending to its urgent medical needs.Chen Kuan-i (陳冠義), director of the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture, told the media that during the process of tracking down the escaped baboon, some members of the department failed to protect the animal or respect its life by engaging in inappropriate behavior, reported CNA. Chen vowed that the department will conduct an in-depth review, including an investigation of himself, and those responsible will be assessed by the performance appraisal committee for appropriate penalties.He expressed regret, saying this was the last result he wanted to see. As for why the baboon was shot and how the hunter was allowed to carry live ammunition in Taoyuan City, Chen said that police will be asked to step up the investigation and on behalf of the department, he expressed regret and anger.In addition, regarding an incident in which Lu Chi-yeh (盧紀燁), a special committee member of the department, took photos of the baboon at the moment it was captured and said he wanted to show his daughter, Chen said that this behavior is not a standard operating procedure, was inappropriate, and should be reviewed.The olive baboon appeared in Taoyuan's Pingzhen District on March 10. Huang Chih-chieh (黃志杰), the borough chief of Zhenxing, led a team to capture the animal but failed.The Taoyuan Department of Agriculture started to track down the baboon on March 23, but the baboon was shot and killed in the Fugang area of Taoyuan's Yangmei District on Monday. That evening, a licensed hunter surnamed Lin (林) confessed to shooting the primate and the case remains under investigation.The body of the baboon was sent to the Taipei Zoo for examination at 9 a.m. on Tuesday. It was then packed in a plastic box and personnel from Taoyuan's Animal Protection Office disinfected the box and placed a funerary cloth and flowers on top.Officials formally bowed to the remains of the baboon, and it was then taken to a vehicle and transported to another location.The Department of Agriculture then held a press conference and the Director of the Animal Protection Office Wang Te-chi (王得吉) was cited by the news agency as saying that at about 2:50 p.m., he was notified the baboon was spotted going inside a house. Wang said that when animal control officers arrived outside the home, it was dark inside, and they were unable to locate the primate.When the animal control officers were stepping out to get a flashlight, they encountered Lin, who happened to have a flashlight, stepped inside, and shot the monkey.Wang said that in the past, animal control officers used traps and tranquilizer guns to capture animals. He said that officers were not aware that Lin was carrying live ammunition.Wang said that at first, everyone thought that the baboon fell to the ground after being hit with a tranquilizer dart. Generally, after being hit with a tranquilizer dart, officers usually wait for the animal to stabilize and confirm that it was immobilized, before taking photos for evidence collection.Wang said that it was not until the animal was placed in a vehicle that blood was seen. Since the cause of the bleeding was uncertain, it was transported to Leofoo Village Theme Park for examination and treatment, but it succumbed to its wounds.Wu Hsiu-chen (吳秀真), head of the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture's Forestry Department, said that after its death, the baboon was sent to the Taipei Zoo to undergo X-rays and DNA collection, according to the news agency. It was then sent to the Council of Agriculture National Institute for Animal Health to undergo an autopsy to determine the cause of death.Wu said the Taoyuan government had not appointed the hunter to assist in the search and capture efforts, nor was he authorized to open fire. Lin on Monday was questioned by officers at the Taoyuan Police Department's Yangmei Precinct and on Tuesday was transferred to the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office to be investigated for violating the Wildlife Conservation Act (野生動物保育法).",2023/3/28,3352,Society

(""OncoVent""), a majority-controlled subsidiary of Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. (the ""Company""), yesterday entered into a license agreement with Orient EuroPharma Co., Ltd. (""OEP"").
According to the terms of the agreement, OncoVent agreed to grant exclusive rights to OEP, which will be responsible for the commercialization of oregovomab, an immunotherapy drug candidate, in Taiwan, including related regulatory applications and necessary clinical trials. OncoVent is entitled to a number of payments from OEP under the license agreement, including a one-off non-refundable upfront payment upon the effective date of the license agreement, multiple regulatory milestone payments, and multiple commercial milestone payments, in a total transaction amount of up to US$11.2 million. OEP also agreed to purchase oregovomab from OncoVent at a price equal to an agreed percentage to the average sale price of oregovomab in Taiwan.
In addition, OncoVent granted OEP the right of first refusal for the exclusive sales, marketing, and distribution right in Hong Kong and Macau.










Oregovomab, a murine monoclonal antibody and a first-in-class anti-CA125 immunotherapy drug candidate, is currently being evaluated in a global Phase III trial using study drugs produced by Cytovance Biologics Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and a leading contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) serving the biopharmaceutical industry.
Prior to this, a Phase II clinical study of oregovomab in combination with standard chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced primary ovarian cancer was already completed. Results from the Phase II clinical trial showed that the safety and efficacy of the combination in patients with advanced primary ovarian cancer were in line with expectations, with the median progression-free-survival (PFS) of the oregovomab plus chemotherapy cohort significantly improved to 41.8 months, compared with 12.2 months with the chemotherapy-only regimen, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28, 0.77). It also showed a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) with an HR of 0.35 (95% Cl: 0.16, 0.76).
Ovarian cancer is ranked the eighth most common cancer in women globally and the first-line treatment for this disease has not changed for many years. Oregovomab has obtained Orphan Drug Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
The first patient in a Phase III clinical trial of oregovomab was dosed in the U.S. in 2020. This global pivotal trial is expected to enroll 602 patients from 190 clinical sites in 17 countries and regions. As of the date of the announcement, the Phase III clinical trial of oregovomab has enrolled 534 subjects globally, of which 21 subjects are from Taiwan.
Mr. Calvin Tsai, Chief Executive Officer of OEP, said, ""we have been actively expanding our oncology portfolio through R&D collaborations and in-licensing, in order to address unmet medical needs in a broad range of tumor types and bring renewed hope to cancer patients in the Asia Pacific region. Hepalink is a leading multinational biopharmaceutical company dual-listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.

He said that by doing so, Sun changed China’s fate and paved the way for the country’s prosperity.He urged Taiwan and China to pursue peace and avoid war as they fight to “reinvigorate China,” calling it “the undeniable responsibility of Chinese across the strait.”In his speech, Ma also highlighted the fact that “it has been 112 years since (Sun) established the republic,” referring to the ROC calendar. While the calendar is still used by the Taiwan public and government, China claims that it, like the ROC itself, is obsolete.In addition to paying respect to Sun and giving a speech, Ma also inscribed in calligraphy the words, “Peacefully fight to reinvigorate China” and dated his work year 112 in addition to 2023.Chinese media coverage of Ma’s visit has been minimal, focusing on his itinerary as well as his urging for peace and unity and praise for Sun as a hero. However, Japanese media speculated that China’s willingness to interact with Kuomintang (KMT) officials, in contrast with its aggressive attitude towards the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), signals its attempt to divide Taiwanese society ahead of the upcoming presidential election.In Taiwan, though Ma’s trip to China was a highly controversial topic, discussion died down after his arrival in Shanghai on Monday (March 27).",2023/3/28,1960,Politics

Stark-Watzinger will be in Taiwan from March 21-22 and is scheduled to meet with National Science and Technology Council Chair Wu Tsung-tsong (吳政忠), Minister of Education Pan Wen-chung (潘文忠), and Minister of Digital Affairs Audrey Tang (唐鳳). Her trip will focus on cooperation in semiconductors, green energy, EV batteries, and Mandarin education.
Stark-Watzinger is the highest-level German official to visit Taiwan since former Minister of Economy Gunter Rexrodt came in 1997, according to the Daily Mirror.
Gudrun Wacker, an expert on Taiwan Strait affairs at the Berlin-based government think tank German Institute for International and Security Affairs (Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik), said that German ministers have stopped visiting Taiwan since the 1990s due to “intensified” political and economic ties with China. Though unofficial exchanges with Taiwan continued, Germany was intent on avoiding any actions that might “annoy” China, Wacker said.










She pointed out that Stark-Watzinger's trip to Taiwan symbolizes Germany’s return to normalcy after decades of self-censorship. She said that “From a Western and German perspective, Taiwan is a valued partner in every sense of the word—a model democracy in Asia that also behaves responsibly internationally.""
Wacker added that deepening exchanges with Taiwan does not violate Germany’s ""one China” policy.
Janka Oertel, Asia director at the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank, praised the education minister’s visit as “exactly the type of cooperation” that Germany wants with Taiwan. “It is a clear signal that these are two progressive governments that want to expand cooperation in the areas of economic innovation, high-tech, and research cooperation,"" she said.
Oertel said the trip also creates awareness in Germany that “Taiwan is a place of freedom, democracy, and innovation whose existence is in danger.” Public attention can help protect it, she said.
“Germany must be clear about the signals it is sending to Taiwan and China,” the director said. Any action should be about ""ensuring Taiwan's security, integrating it internationally, and protecting it from violent annexation by China,"" she added.

Any action should be about ""ensuring Taiwan's security, integrating it internationally, and protecting it from violent annexation by China,"" she added.Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs offered to set up a meeting between Stark-Watzinger and Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) but Berlin declined, according to the Financial Times.",2023/3/20,597,Politics

Shih added that it is obligatory for the government to act, according to CNA.While it is not likely to stop scalper bots, the regulatory changes expected to be approved by April will seek to introduce harsh punitive measures for profiteering resellers as long as the sales are made public, he said. Ticket distributors and event organizers will also be asked to help counteract scalping through moves such as offering ticket exchange platforms, he added.Some scalpers were found to be selling Blackpink tickets for four times the official prices, and in one case even charging NT$400,000 (US$13,089) for a seat. Ticket scalping is common for concerts featuring popular artists like A-Mei and Mayday, as well as sports events, while the Consumers’ Foundation also flagged hospitals falling prey to “registration scalping” for those seeking an appointment with popular doctors.",2023/3/20,2684,Society

This is despite the average frequency of trains departing the station being half that of other stations.This has led to accusations that MRT officials are not doing enough to alleviate crowded MRT platforms and traffic. New Taipei City Councilor Cheng Yu-en (鄭宇恩) appealed to New Taipei City Hall to consider increasing the number of MRT trains departing Tamsui Station, per UDN.As of February, the top MRT stations in terms of passenger volume were Taipei Main Station, Taipei City Government, Ximen, Zhongshan, Zhongxiao-Fuxing, Banciao, Tamsui, Nanjing-Fuxing, Xinpu, and Taipei 101/World Trade CenterCheng said many of these stations see MRT trains departing every three minutes, though only Tamsui has trains departing every six minutes during peak travel time.According to Cheng, the Tamsui-Xinyi Line, also known as the Red Line, is divided into two parts: Tamsui-Xiangshan and Daan-Beitou. During rush hour, the two sections of the route run every six minutes.Cheng said if the Daan-Beitou section was extended to Tamsui, the frequency of MRT trains on the line could be shortened to three minutes, and the commuting problem in Tamsui could be alleviated.Cheng said in the past that DORTS has wanted to increase the frequency many times but ignored the interests of commuters. He also noted that shops and markets around the Tamsui Station may benefit from less frequent trains as it may encourage more commuters to shop while they wait for their trains.One passenger, surnamed Lin (林), pointed out that Tamsui is quite far from downtown areas in Taipei with many people needing to sit for the duration of the trip. Should one desire a seat, they may have to wait for two to three trains to pass.Lin hoped DORTS could do more to increase the number of MRT trains, which may increase the public's willingness to take the MRT and end dependency upon public buses which operate in the area.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841191,Putin to host ally Xi in Russia as Ukraine war rages,"Russian President Vladimir Putin hosts Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday hoping for support against Western pressure over his war in Ukraine while Xi will present China as a global peacemaker intent on brokering an end to the conflict.
Xi will be the first national leader to shake Putin's hand since the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him on Friday over the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia since its invasion.
Moscow rejects the charge and Beijing said it reflects double standards.
Russia is presenting Xi's trip, his first since securing an unprecedented third term this month, as evidence that it has a powerful friend prepared to stand with it against a hostile West that it accuses of trying to isolate and defeat Moscow.
""We can feel the geopolitical landscape in the outside world undergoing drastic changes,"" Putin said in an article in China's People's Daily published on the Kremlin website, adding that he had high hopes for the visit from his ""good old friend"".
For Xi, the visit is a diplomatic tightrope.
China has released a 12-point proposal to solve the Ukraine crisis, but at the same time strengthened ties with Moscow.
China has repeatedly dismissed Western accusations that it is planning to arm Russia but says it wants a closer energy partnership after boosting imports of Russian coal, gas and oil following Putin's all-out invasion of Ukraine. Western sanctions on Russian energy mean Beijing has saved billions of dollars.
In an article published at the beginning of his visit to Moscow, Xi said the two countries adhered to the concept of ""eternal friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation"".
China's Ukraine peace proposal, released last month, reflects global views and acknowledges difficulties, he said.
""Complex problems do not have simple solutions,"" Xi wrote in Rossiiskaya Gazeta, a daily published by the Russian government, according to a Reuters translation from Russian.
Ukraine and its Western backers would be likely to dismiss any attempt to secure a ceasefire as little more than a ploy to buy Putin time to reinforce, and delay a widely expected Ukrainian counter-offensive.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he will only consider peace settlements after Russian troops leave Ukrainian territory.
China's proposal contains only general statements and no concrete proposal on how to end the year-long war which has killed tens of thousands of people, destroyed cities and forced millions to flee.
Putin welcomed China's offer to mediate. He signed a ""no limits"" strategic partnership with Xi last year shortly before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine to end what he said was a threat to Russia from its moves towards the West.
The United States and its allies are deeply sceptical of China's motives, noting it has declined to condemn Russia and given it an economic lifeline as others impose sanctions.
Alongside growing oil and coal deliveries to China, Putin said Russia was helping to build nuclear power reactors there and the two countries were deepening cooperation in space exploration and new technologies.
The United States and the transatlantic military alliance NATO have recently accused China of considering supplying arms to Russia and warned it against doing so.
China has dismissed the accusations.
WAR CRIMES, ARTILLERY SHELLS
Justice ministers from around the world will meet in London on Monday to discuss support for the ICC.
""We are gathering in London today united by one cause: to hold war criminals to account for the atrocities committed in Ukraine during this unjust, unprovoked and unlawful invasion,"" British Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said.
Several European Union countries will sign an agreement on Monday in Brussels to buy 155 mm artillery shells for Ukraine, with the first orders possibly placed by the end of May.
Ukraine has identified the shells' supply as critical, with both sides firing thousands of rounds every day.
In Ukraine, fierce fighting continued in the eastern town of Bakhmut with each side launching counter offensives. Ukrainian forces have held out in Bakhmut since last summer in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war.
Giving its regular morning roundup from the front, Ukraine's military said defenders in Bakhmut, Lyman, Ivanivske, Bohdanivka and Hryhorivka - all towns in the Donetsk region - had repelled 69 Russian attacks in the past day.
""Bakhmut remains the epicentre of hostilities,"" it said.
British intelligence said Ukrainian supply lines both west of Bakhmut and west of the town of Avdiivka, further south, were under pressure.
Ukraine's military said that Russian forces were on the defensive in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions to the south.
Russia's Wagner mercenary group which is spearheading the assault on Bakhmut and has suffered heavy losses, plans to recruit some 30,000 new fighters by the middle of May, its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said at the weekend.
In January, the United States assessed that Wagner had about 50,000 fighters in Ukraine, including 40,000 convicts Prigozhin had recruited from Russian prisons with a promise of a pardon if they survived six months.
Ukrainian officials have said that some 30,000 of Wagner's fighters have deserted or been killed or wounded, a figure that could not be independently verified.Russian President Vladimir Putin hosts Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday hoping for support against Western pressure over his war in Ukraine while Xi will present China as a global peacemaker intent on brokering an end to the conflict.Xi will be the first national leader to shake Putin's hand since the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him on Friday over the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia since its invasion.Moscow rejects the charge and Beijing said it reflects double standards.Russia is presenting Xi's trip, his first since securing an unprecedented third term this month, as evidence that it has a powerful friend prepared to stand with it against a hostile West that it accuses of trying to isolate and defeat Moscow.""We can feel the geopolitical landscape in the outside world undergoing drastic changes,"" Putin said in an article in China's People's Daily published on the Kremlin website, adding that he had high hopes for the visit from his ""good old friend"".For Xi, the visit is a diplomatic tightrope.China has released a 12-point proposal to solve the Ukraine crisis, but at the same time strengthened ties with Moscow.China has repeatedly dismissed Western accusations that it is planning to arm Russia but says it wants a closer energy partnership after boosting imports of Russian coal, gas and oil following Putin's all-out invasion of Ukraine. Western sanctions on Russian energy mean Beijing has saved billions of dollars.In an article published at the beginning of his visit to Moscow, Xi said the two countries adhered to the concept of ""eternal friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation"".China's Ukraine peace proposal, released last month, reflects global views and acknowledges difficulties, he said.""Complex problems do not have simple solutions,"" Xi wrote in Rossiiskaya Gazeta, a daily published by the Russian government, according to a Reuters translation from Russian.Ukraine and its Western backers would be likely to dismiss any attempt to secure a ceasefire as little more than a ploy to buy Putin time to reinforce, and delay a widely expected Ukrainian counter-offensive.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he will only consider peace settlements after Russian troops leave Ukrainian territory.China's proposal contains only general statements and no concrete proposal on how to end the year-long war which has killed tens of thousands of people, destroyed cities and forced millions to flee.Putin welcomed China's offer to mediate. He signed a ""no limits"" strategic partnership with Xi last year shortly before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine to end what he said was a threat to Russia from its moves towards the West.The United States and its allies are deeply sceptical of China's motives, noting it has declined to condemn Russia and given it an economic lifeline as others impose sanctions.Alongside growing oil and coal deliveries to China, Putin said Russia was helping to build nuclear power reactors there and the two countries were deepening cooperation in space exploration and new technologies.The United States and the transatlantic military alliance NATO have recently accused China of considering supplying arms to Russia and warned it against doing so.China has dismissed the accusations.Justice ministers from around the world will meet in London on Monday to discuss support for the ICC.""We are gathering in London today united by one cause: to hold war criminals to account for the atrocities committed in Ukraine during this unjust, unprovoked and unlawful invasion,"" British Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said.Several European Union countries will sign an agreement on Monday in Brussels to buy 155 mm artillery shells for Ukraine, with the first orders possibly placed by the end of May.Ukraine has identified the shells' supply as critical, with both sides firing thousands of rounds every day.In Ukraine, fierce fighting continued in the eastern town of Bakhmut with each side launching counter offensives. Ukrainian forces have held out in Bakhmut since last summer in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war.Giving its regular morning roundup from the front, Ukraine's military said defenders in Bakhmut, Lyman, Ivanivske, Bohdanivka and Hryhorivka - all towns in the Donetsk region - had repelled 69 Russian attacks in the past day.""Bakhmut remains the epicentre of hostilities,"" it said.British intelligence said Ukrainian supply lines both west of Bakhmut and west of the town of Avdiivka, further south, were under pressure.Ukraine's military said that Russian forces were on the defensive in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions to the south.Russia's Wagner mercenary group which is spearheading the assault on Bakhmut and has suffered heavy losses, plans to recruit some 30,000 new fighters by the middle of May, its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said at the weekend.In January, the United States assessed that Wagner had about 50,000 fighters in Ukraine, including 40,000 convicts Prigozhin had recruited from Russian prisons with a promise of a pardon if they survived six months.Ukrainian officials have said that some 30,000 of Wagner's fighters have deserted or been killed or wounded, a figure that could not be independently verified.",2023/3/20,334,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841208,65% of companies in Taiwan polled have at least one woman in C-suite,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) —  The British Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (BCCTaipei) recently hosted the Women in Business Forum: Climate Action Taiwan to present the findings of its cross-industry research on the status of women in climate action in Taiwan.According to the report, there are three key suggestions for increasing female representation, including hardline governmental legislation for businesses, tax breaks to incentivize female promotion, and regulations to appoint at least one female director per organization. Additionally, the report recommends identifying more creative means to facilitate women’s entry into in-demand industries where they are underrepresented.The research also examines the wide variety of measures adopted by private organizations to tackle climate change in keeping with local policies and legislation.Survey results showed that 80% of organizations are taking steps to reduce their impact on the environment. Meanwhile, 53.3% implement initiatives to attract and retain female employees.Responding organizations, ranging in size from one to almost 4,700 employees, reported that 81.9% have at least one female manager in C-suite positions, and 65.3% have at least one woman in a director’s position or above.Although the representation of women in Taiwan is growing, BCCTaipei’s interviews reveal barriers to gender equality. These include family pressures to prioritize childcare, discrimination from employers, perceptions about women’s role at work, a culture of male dominance in certain industries, a lack of investment in female-oriented training schemes, and few women pursuing university degrees in ICT and STEM fields.Another criticism is that employment policies tend to focus on pregnancy and childcare, rather than cultivating talent or promoting women to senior positions.At the event, Director-General Tsai Lin-yi (蔡玲儀) of Taiwan’s Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), said that Taiwan, ranked first in Asia for gender equality and is dedicated to empowering female leadership. ""Women’s contribution to reaching our collective goal of ‘Net-Zero by 2050’ in line with COP26 is essential for Taiwan’s future,"" she said.John Dennis, representative of the British Office in Taipei, said gender equality and green energy represent two core priorities for the British government’s ""Global Britain"" agenda, and he is delighted to see the progress made across a variety of industries in Taiwan. ""The UK has a profound role to play in Taiwan’s transition to clean, carbon-free energy through the development of strategic sectors such as offshore wind, and I look forward to further cooperation in the coming years.”Chair of BCCTaipei General Committee, Carl Blundon, talked about the organization's research, which offers valuable insights into women’s role in the climate debate. He said championing gender equality is not only vital for the success of private organizations, but for all aspects of wider society in Taiwan and abroad.",2023/3/24,346,Business
